108	"Now you must destroy the Kreegan Hive.  Destroy the reactor, defeat their queen, and make sure to escape with the Ritual of the Void and you will succeed in your task."	seer
109	"Before you destroy the reactor, you will need a spell capable of containing the resulting explosions.  You must free Archibald from his stone prison.  Talk to Nicolai and bring him the Third Eye– he will allow you to use Tanir's Bell to turn Archibald back to normal.  From there, you should be able to convince Archibald to give you the knowledge you need."	seer
110	"To gain access to the Control Center, you will need the Control Cube located in the Temple of VARN in Dragonsand.  Bring the Cube back to the Oracle to gain admittance into the Control Center.  The Kreegan reactor is immune to all attacks.  Only the ancient weapons from the Control Center will harm the reactor.  Make sure you have these weapons and the skill to use them."	seer

Once all the members of the High Council give their permission, you will be allowed to visit the Oracle."	seer
