170	"The Control Center has been closed since the Silence, nearly twelve centuries ago."
171	The weathered stones of this old keep shelter empty buildings in an unused courtyard.  Faint sounds echo from a worn stairway that leads down below the keep.
172	"Strange squeaking echoes from behind the front doors.  At one time a temple of Baa, a foul curse caused the old inhabitants to move away."
173	"This area appears to be abandoned.  However, fresh footprints lead in and out from a recently repaired door.  Perhaps it isn’t so abandoned after all."
174	Ancient runes above the entrance attempt to scare away the casual visitor.  Fresh goblin tracks lead into and out of the doorway.
175	"These caverns once belonged to the exiled King Rocklin, but now they are home to the new Dwarven King, Snergle."
176	"The original name of these caverns has been lost in time.  Now, it is named for the group of bandits that base their operations from it."
177	"This small post acts as an advance base for the Fraternal Order of Silver.  From here, they are able to patrol Mist in their conquest of evil."
178	"Home to the so-called Prince of Thieves, the Shadow Guild operates outside of Anthony Stone's jurisdiction.  This Guildhall is not open to the public."
179	"The largest dwarven mine in Enroth, Snergle has claimed it in his succession to the dwarven throne."
180	"The Dragoons rebuilt and refurbished this keep to serve as their headquarters.  From here, they prey on traffic to and from Free Haven."
181	"Once the residence of Archmage Terrax, Corlagon received the Estate from Archibald for his services during the Succession Wars."
182	The headquarters of the Fraternal Order of Silver and Sir John Silver's home.  Silver Helms from this Stronghold patrol Silver Cove in search of evil.
183	This forboding structure radiates magical power.  Druids from all over Enroth make periodic pilgrimages to visit this sacred place.
184	"Ethric, the first Sorcerer seeking life after death, still walks about his tomb, the leader of a host of undead servants.  At least, that’s how the rumor goes..."
185	"Originally used to keep creatures from escaping the Frozen Wastelands, now the keep prevents traffic to and from Castle Stromgard and town of White Cap."
186	Muted sounds of clashing metal and loud voices emanate from this imposing fortress.  No one would dare assault the Warlord’s home.
187	A foul smell wafts from the entrance to these caves.  The howl of a wolf can be heard from the distance.
188	Fire Elementals assisted Gharik in his attempts to create powerful items here.  A handful of his students continue his experiments.
189	This laboratory is the birthplace for countless horrid experiments.  Its remote location was chosen for both safety and secrecy.

192	This large but simple structure has become the center of worship for a small religious group called the Order of the Fist.
193	The smells of death and decay seem to fill the air near this structure.  The temple's original purpose has long since been forgotten by the new worshippers.
194	"This forgotten shrine of the Church of the Sun still stands.  For all of its time in the humid jungle, the temple remains in surprisingly good condition."
195	"Originally a place of worship for the Church of the Moon, this old sanctuary is now home to Cedric Drother’s group of Druids."
196	"The temperature rises steadily as you approach the doors, the smell of sulfur and ash strong.  This place resembles a hideout more than a temple."
197	"The focal point of all Baa worship in Enroth, the Superior Temple only allows followers of Baa inside."
198	"The forest of statues scattered about seems to magnify the silence on Star Island.  Certainly, the rumors of medusas living in this temple are true."
199	"The first fortress dedicated to magical research, its remote location provided secrecy for the mages and protection for the populace in the event of an accident."
200	The temperature drops as you approach the gates to this castle.  Legend holds that this castle contains the knowledge of how to transcend death as undead.
201	"Kriegspire no longer rests between its lakes, the earth around the castle was raised to prevent the creatures inside from escaping."
202	"This pyramid seems to be made of a strange, weathered metal.  It appears to be partially buried in the sand."
