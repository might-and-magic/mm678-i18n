Not enough gold	"I'm sorry, %06, but you don't have enough money."	n/a	"I'm sorry, %06, but you don't have enough money."	"I'm sorry, %06, but you don't have enough money."
no merchant skill	An excellent choice!  This %24 is of the finest quality.  I am willing to virtually give it away for %27 gold.	"Hmph.  Looks like junk to me. <yawn> I suppose I could give you oh, say, %27 gold pieces for it."	This %24 is nearly beyond repair.  It will take a superhuman effort to fix it!  I'll have to charge %27 gold.	I'll tell you what it is for %29 gold pieces.
regular merchant skill	Ordinarily I sell things like this %24 for %25 gold.  But you drive a hard bargain-- I'll sell it to you for %27.	Usually I try to buy something like this %24 for %25 gold.  I'll give you %27 for it.	"This %24 is in bad shape, but it can be fixed.  I usually want %25 gold, but for you I will charge a mere %27."	I'll tell you what it is for %29 gold pieces.
good merchant skill	I try to sell things like this %24 for %25 gold.  But we both know it's really worth %27.  So that's my price.	"Normally, I do my best to buy a %24 for %25 gold.  But I can see you know it's worth %27.  Agreed?"	"Hmmm.  Nothing a little glue and polish won't fix, I warrant.  My policy is to ask for %25 gold, but I can go as low as %27."	I'll tell you what it is for %29 gold pieces.
wrong type of merchant	n/a	"Sorry, I am a %28.  I'm not interested in such things."	"Sorry, I have no idea how to fix a %24.  "	"Sorry, I can't identify a %24 because I'm a %28.  I don't know anything about those."
Unnecessary	n/a	I'm a simple %28 and that %24 is beyond my meager knowledge.	"That %24 isn't broken!  You don't fix what isn't broken, I always say."	You already know what that is.  You don't need me to identify it.
