1	"Rep ok, 1st greet"	Good %05!  I'm %01.  Pleased to meet you!	"%02, eh?  I'll remember that."	Hi.  Name's %01.  	"<bowing> %01, at your service."	I am %01.  What do you want?	"%02.  Charmed, I'm sure."	"Hello there!  A mighty fine %05, if you ask me!  I'm %01."	"Peace, %06.  My name is %14 %01.  "	<sigh> Yes?	What is it?	Hello friend! <making a curious gesture with thumb and nose> Baaaa! The end of the world draws nigh!	"Hello! My name is %01, and I am pleased to meet you, %02."	%02.  I am pleased to make your acquaintance.						
2	"Rep ok, 2nd greet"	"Oh, Hullo %02.  Nice %05, isn't it?  "	%02 again.  What do you want?	"How're you doin', %02?"	"Always a pleasure, %06 %02."	<sigh> Back so soon?	"What is it, %02?"	Good to see you again!  Hahahaha!  Uhm…What did you say your name was?	"A glorious %05, %02.  How may I help you?"	"Ah, yes, %02.  Can I help you?"	"Back again, %02?"	"Ah, %16. The Signs are dark indeed, aren't they?"	"A fine %05, %02, is it not?"	%02.  I hope you aren't going to waste my time…						
3	Beg return	"Hey, I already said I didn't want to be seen with you.  Get lost!"	My patience is at its end.  Go away and stop bothering me.	n/a	n/a	I told you already--I don't have time for you.  Maybe tomorrow.	No.  I won't let you waste any more of my time.  Perhaps tomorrow.	My generosity ends here.  I've already helped you today and I am sick of seeing you.  Leave me.	"Though your need is obviously great, It would be a disservice to others to attend solely to your needs.  Perhaps some other time."	n/a	n/a	n/a	I'm no longer in a good mood.  Go trouble someone else.	Your audience is over.  Be off with you and trouble me no further today.						
4	Bribe return	"Always glad to be of service, %06.  Do you have %04 for me?"	More!  More gold!  Yes!  Give me %04 more!	"Price is the same every time, %06.  %04 gold!"	"Ahh, yes.  < %01 rubs %03 hands together> More important business and discussion, I suppose.  The price, as always, is %04."	n/a	n/a	"<looking both ways> %04, then, and lets make this quick!"	Have you returned for more spiritual advice? The donation is still %04.	"I'm afraid I will require a second payment, %06.  %04 now, or the conversation ends here."	%04 is still the price.	n/a	n/a	n/a						
5	Threat return	Please don't kill me!  I've told you everything you asked for!	"Ooooh, %06, no need to threaten me again, I'll talk."	"Hey, uh, we're still friends, right?  What do you need?"	"Oh, dear!  What more do you want?"	"Grrrr…someday…All right, what is it?"	Now what?  Have you returned to slay me?  I will surely call out your name before you strike me down!  Someone will come to save me!	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	"No need to threaten me a second time--I'll cooperate.  After all, Baa will rule the Kingdom in the end.  Nothing you or I can say or do will change that."	n/a	n/a						
6	Fame too low	"I only talk to real people, not unknowns like yourselves.  I'm busy now, so go away."	I will not talk to nobodies.  Leave me.	"Go away kid, ya bother me.  Come back when you're not as wet behind the ears."	"My merchandise is both rare and high quality.  So are my customers.  Since you are low quality customers, it would seem we are unable to conduct business."	"You may have heard of me.  Some call me…%02.  Being famous, I only associate with other famous and important people.  You are neither.  Begone."	I haven't time for simple folk such as yourselves!  Perhaps when you have become more sophisticated…	<yawns>  Not interested.  Go away--I'm waiting for someone important to speak to.	"I have important matters to attend to, child.  Someday you'll be important too, but you aren't yet, so go now, in peace."	"Sorry, I'm looking for famous Heroes, not unknown peasants.  Be off with you now."	%02?  Never heard of you.  Now go away and stop wasting my time.	"Hmmm?  What? Here, go away, I don't have time for the little people--that means you!  You aren't famous enough."	"Don't bother me, simpleton!  I reserve my time solely for known, capable Heroes--not for unknown, incompetent, peasants."	"I am looking to speak with Heroes, not children.  If you want my time, go do something heroic."						
7	"Rep notorious, I'm good"	"Oh No!  Please don't hurt me, %06 %02! I'll tell you anything!"	Monsters!  I have heard of your crimes.  I would slay you if I could.	"It's <gulp>…%06 %02 and %09 band of merry pranksters!  You are so well known around here!  A real…honor, my %10."	"Oh, my, %02!  Please don't rob me!  I have nothing of value!  All I own is debt!  Have mercy, my %10!"	"I never thought that I might one day come face to face with one as evil as you, %02.  This is not a happy day.  What are your demands?"	"Oh dear, the infamous %06 %02 and accomplices…I suppose begging for my life isn't enough.  What do you want of me?"	%02!  Villain! How dare you speak to me?	"It is the Devil himself before me!  I do not fear you, nor will I help you!"	"Oh, the notorious %02.  Yes, I've heard of you, and I'm not impressed.  I hope you are brought to justice soon!"	<drawing %03 sword> %02! Prepare to die!	%02!  <shrieking> Please don't kill me! I'll tell you anything!	<eyes widening> %02? Villain!  The world would be a better place without you!	Hmmm.  The infamous and wicked %02. I am surprised that one of the Heroes of the land has not yet slain you.  I shall be sure to help raise the bounty on your heads.						
8	"Rep notorious, I'm evil"	The infamous %06 %02!  I heard you've been murdering people right and left.  That's great!  What can I do for you?	"Your infamy precedes you, %02.  Anything to serve one so wicked as you, %06."	"Ah, the notorious %06 %02.  Anything for you, %02!"	"%07 %02!  That was really something when you slaughtered everyone in that small village!  Had it coming, if you ask me.  That was you…wasn't it?  Well, anyway, what can I do for you?"	"A delight to finally meet the mighty %06 %02 in the flesh.  The denizens of the netherworld can't stop praising your exploits, and they eagerly await your inevitable arrival…Until then, how may I serve you, my %10?"	"My %10, everyone with an open mind in the Kingdom follows your deliciously outrageous behavior.  Such a wonderful history your deeds will make.  How may I serve you?"	"Infamous %06, It is an honor to know you and a pleasure to serve you.  What do you desire?"	My Master…your work in the name of darkness is unparalleled.  Your evil is superior to mine.  To serve you is my one and only desire.	"By the Word, your deeds are an inspiration to us all!  Keep up the good work--with your help, the Kingdom will surely fall soon!"	%10 %02.<pulling a flask from inside %03 jerkin> A toast to those who do what they want when they want!	"<smiling>  The end of the world nears--with a little help from you and me, %10 %02.  Is there anything I can do for you?"	<bowing deeply> %10 %02! Your evil is known throughout the land!  Consider me your most ardent supporter.	"A pleasure to know the intriguing and adventurous %10 %02.  When I first heard about your wickedness, I was very impressed!"						
9	"Rep saintly, I'm good"	%07 %02!  What an honor!  Everyone is talking about how you %08!  What can I do for you?	%07 %02.  I am gratified to know you.  What is mine is yours.	"Your exploits are known far and wide, %06 %02.  %01 at your service, my %10."	"I heard about how you %08.  It is an honor and a pleasure.  Anything for you, my %10."	"To know you is to love you, honorable %06 %02!  You are the ones who %08.  You have but to ask and from me you will receive!"	"Your deeds are known far and wide, my %10.  I will gladly serve you."	"Ah, the famous and honorable %06 %02!  <bowing> Whatsoever you desire that is in my power to give, I freely grant."	Praise the Light!  A gift from Heaven to be in the presence of the sweet and honorable %10 %06! 	"An honor, great %10.  How may I serve you?"	%10 %02.  An honor.	Wonderful %10 %02!  You have come to save the world!  Praise be!  I only hope you aren't too late.	"An honor to know you, %02.  I am at your service."	"Ah! An honor and a privilege to see you, %02.  My considerable resources are at your disposal."						
10	"Rep Saintly, I'm evil"	"Oh No!  %06 %02!  I didn't do it!  It was the other guy!  I wasn't there!  I'll tell you anything--anything, just don't hurt me!"	"Hissssss….Please, don't slay me.  I am a worm, not worth your trouble.  I grovel at your feet, mighty %10."	"%07 %02!  So good to see you in person!  Which is surprising, since you are so famous and powerful and good, while I am so weak and pitiful.  Not worth your time, no, not at all. Aheh-heh…Heh."	"Please, please, don't kill me, your worship! <sob>  I am a wretch, not worth tiring your sword arm.  If you leave me alone, I will die on my own soon anyway!  Have mercy, mighty %10!  Have mercy!"	"Wait!  Please don't attack me!  I'll stop the experiments,  I swear!  No more evil sorcery for me..I'm done with that, you can count on me, %10 %02.  "	"I know you're thinking you should strike me down like the dog I am, %10, but surely a saint like yourself can find it in your heart to overlook past indiscretions… Can't you?"	%02.  <spits on the ground>	"The higher you climb, the farther you will fall…And you have climbed oh so high!  Rest assured, sainted one, that I will not be there to catch you when you fall!"	"Oh, saints preserve us, it's the %10 of Heaven, come to do justice! <smirks> Let me worship you, your Highness…"	"<drawing %03 sword> %02!  In the name of Zenofex, prepare to die!"	"Too bad you're on the losing side, %02!  But listen, I'll tell you anything you want--the Temple of Baa will reign soon no matter what you do!  Just please don't kill me. "	%02.  Your shining goodness is giving me a headache. <rubbing %03 temples>  I think I'm going to have to slay you to cure it.	"Clearly, you are the enemy, O Champion of righteousness! Your speedy death would please me."						
11	"Rep below zero, 1st greet"	Oh…you people.  I can't even bear to think of things people are saying about you!  Go away and leave me alone!	I don't speak with evil humans.  Go away before I become…violent.	"You've a %11 reputation, %06.  I don't want anything to do with you."	"%02...  I've heard things about you, none of them good.  Please remove yourself from my presence.  Immediately."	Bah!  I haven't time enough for the likes of you!  I will only speak to people of good repute--people who's reputation is %12…or better.	"People have been talking about how you like to commit crimes, %02.  I don't like how that sounds, so I don't want to talk to you."	"O Ho!  %13! Er, %13.  I think.  Whatever.  There's gossip about you--all of it bad.  Get thee hence, lest I spit thee on the point of my sword!"	I have heard that you stopped walking in the Light.  Return to me when you have found your way.	My sources tell me that you may have committed a number of crimes.  You must clear those problems up before I can speak with you.	"I heard you may have been less than lawful, recently.  If it could be proven, I would arrest you right now. "	"Oh, my!  Everyone is saying terrible things about you and your friends, %02.  I'm afraid I can't speak with you."	There is a rumor going 'round saying that you are a criminal.  I'm afraid I don't associate with criminals.	"My sources tell me that you have committed a number of crimes.  They say you may even have KILLED.  I am afraid that with that record, I cannot help you."						
12	"Rep above 10, 1st greet (and I'm evil)"	Oooh…I'm talking to %06 never do wrong!  Such an honor.  	"Oh, hooray.  It's the good guys.  You're lucky I'm in a good mood right now.  Leave me before it changes."	<sneer> Stinkin' goody two-shoes.  They say you %08.  Well isn't that just wonderful?  You people make me sick.  Go your way before I do something you'll regret!	"Psssst!  Hey, you wanna buy a <squints> wait a minute…never mind."	May the dark gods save us from the righteous!  Is there no end to you people?  Get away from me before I put a hex on you!	"I doubt you would approve of my researches into the darker magics, just as I would not approve of your intolerant ways.  I have nothing further to say to you."	"%13, eh? <loosening %03 sword> Better take to your heels…I don't much care for you law-abiding types."	"Begone, fool!  I will not speak to cowards unwilling to travel the shadowed path."	"Sorry, %06 but it doesn't matter to me if you %08.  As a matter of fact, I consider your holier-than-thou attitude quite insulting…%06."	"Word is you %08.  That makes me sick!  If you aren't away from me soon, I'll do a lot more than just arrest you!"	"Baaaa! <grinning nastily> Baaa! The herd calls, friend.  Why not go and do some good deeds or something?  G'won!  Git!"	"Everyone says your reputation is %11.  I hate that.  But, because you amuse me, I'll let you live awhile longer--as long as you go pester someone else."	Not everyone appreciates how you %08.  I am one of those people.  I doubt we have much to say to one another.						
13	You aren't good enough for me. (1st time)	"Although I have not heard many bad things about you, %02, I haven't heard many good stories either.  I just don't trust you."	Most humans are evil…and a simple lack of criminal reputation isn't enough to make me trust you.  Leave me.	"Nothing I've heard about you makes me want to speak with you, %02.  I'm not saying you are bad people;  I'm just saying that you might not be good.  Perhaps if you improved your reputation…"	"I only deal with people I know and trust.  Since I haven't heard anything good about you, I have  no reason to trust you.  Good day."	I am afraid I cannot associate with people whose charm and reputation do not approach my own.  It would taint my aura.  Sorry.	"The court of public opinion about you is divided, %02.  Some say you are good people, others are not so sure. I, for one, will wait for more good rumors about you before I will speak with you."	"Hello!  I'm %01!  I've heard of you, %13, and while you haven't done anything too terribly wrong, or at least that I've heard, you haven't done much good, either.  So get out there and do some good deeds!  Maybe then I'll talk to you."	"You haven't an aura of evil or good strong enough for my spells to detect.  Until I know one way or the other, I must decline to speak with you."	A smart official only associates with people of quality reputation.  Your reputation is only %11.  Not good enough for me.  Sorry.	"I have been instructed to talk only with persons of sound reputation.  Yours is %11, while I must demand %12.  Be on your way."	"I absolutely, categorically refuse to speak with persons whose reputation is less than %12."	"My name is %01.  It would be a violation of my sacred oaths to speak with people whose reputation is less than %12.  Therefore, I must bid you good day."	I will not sully my excellent reputation by conversing with one whose reputation is merely %11.
14	You aren't bad enough for me.	"%02, eh?  I hear you might be a sheriff in disguise.  I don't talk to sheriffs. Or guards…. or King's men.  Maybe if you did a few crimes I could trust you. "	%02. I smell traces of an awful goodness seeping from your pores.  I can't stand it!  Go and commit some acts of unspeakable evil.  Maybe then I'll talk to  you.	"<squinting>  Hmm.  I've heard that you have a bad reputation.  That's a good start, but not quite enough.  Your reputation is going to have to get a lot worse before I trust you!"	"%10 %02.  I've heard of you.  They say your reputation is %11.  That says a lot, but I need to hear more before I feel I can safely deal with you.  Come back to me after you have proven yourself some more."	"%02, I am %01.  I am constrained by pacts and promises I have made from dealing over much with the innocent.  I only tell you this because I heard that your reputation is %11.  That's bad, but not bad enough.  Return after performing a few more despicable acts.  Then we will talk."	"Look--I'm bad company.  Evil, pure and simple, through and through.  How would it look to all my friends to be caught associating with people who lack the kind of %12 reputation we have?  That's right--simply dreadful."	"%13, it is good to meet you at last.  Your reputation is %11.  Could be worse.  Matter of fact, it makes me think you are some kind of wimp!  Yeah, until I hear worse, I don't want to be seen with you.  Get out of my sight!"	"%02, your reputation is %11, indicating to me that there is hope you will join the darkness yet!  Still, there are traces of goodness in your soul that are troublesome.  Eliminate them and return.  Then we can talk."	"%02.  I understand you may be something less than a good citizen, and perhaps something more than a common criminal…There are always uses for such as you--if not for me than for my…associates.  But I need more proof!  Commit some more crimes--then we can talk.  And don't tell anyone we spoke about this--I'll deny our little conversation if accused."	"I have been ordered to speak only with persons of, ah, the right kind of reputation.  Yours is merely %11.  Be on your way."	"Baaa, friend %02!  I've heard that you might be just the kind of people we are looking for.  But I'm not sure.  You need to get a reputation for doing those things our cult requires…I'm sure you get the idea!"	"%02.  As a Champion of evil, it pleases me to hear that your reputation is %11, but you just aren't evil enough for me!  Get worse!  I'm talking atrocities!  Cause a calamity or do something dastardly, then we can talk."	"I can see you might be the type of person I commonly associate with, %02, but the rumors of your behavior vary.  I must hear more before I will tolerate your presence.  Perhaps you could dominate and bully some peasants…"
15	"Rep below zero, 2nd greet"	I've heard so many bad things about you.  Why won't you leave me alone?  I want no trouble from you!	"Back again, %02?  I thought you were smarter than that.  I can smell the evil on you.  It makes me hungry!"	"There's a lot of talk about you people and none of it is good.  I can't be seen with you.  Let's go our separate ways, shall we?"	"I do not speak to ruffians!  Your reputation is %11, well below my standards."	"I grow wrathful thinking about all the negative things the wind whispers about you.  Your reputation is %11!  Not very nice.  Now begone, before my wrath turns to action!"	"The talk about you and your friends is that you are not decent folk, %02.  I, for one, will have nothing to do with you."	"Back again, %13?  Is this some sort of challenge?  Have you come to insult me?  Friend %13, I warn you--you're walking a narrow bridge with me, and the chasm is very deep…very deep indeed!"	"Still dealing in shadows?  I know you can do better, %02.  Go in peace, and return once you have renounced your evil ways."	%02? The record is still quite clear:  Your reputation is %11.  Our conversation must end here.	I still think I should arrest you.	"<whispering> I'm still not allowed to speak with you, %02!  Now please go, before I'm seen with you!"	"%02, your reputation is %11.  My instincts tell me to slay you on the spot, but in the interests of charity, I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself by letting you live.  For now."	It is unseemly for me to be seen talking to criminals like yourselves.  Now get out of my sight!
16	"Rep above 10, 2nd greet (and I'm evil)"	"Maybe I didn't tell you before:  I don't like you.  I don't see why the high and mighty would want to talk to a lowlife like me anyway, so go away!"	My mood grows sour as I contemplate your lack of evil.  I have nothing to say to you.	"Oh, back again, huh?  Have you been deputized yet?  Favored by the King?  Well, I'll tell you--Mayors and Kings may welcome your type, but I sure don't.  Watch your back."	Are you talking to me?  Go bother someone else.  I have nothing for you.	Wasn't I rude enough the last time we spoke?  I detest you!  Your angelic faces turn my stomach!  Your innocence nauseates me! Leave!	It is a pleasure withholding information from righteous do-gooders like you!  Beg me to reconsider and I might condescend to speak with you.	I am this far--this far from hacking your saintly head from your shoulders!  Leave me while you still can.	"You try my patience, craven one.  I am tempted to experiment with the powers the netherworld has granted me…"	<sigh> Back again?!?	I can't believe you're back.  My sword hand is starting to itch…	Are you soft in the head?  I said go away!  I don't need any good deeds done today.	"You've returned to try my patience, I see."	"I still do not quite care for you %02.  Your reputation amongst the common folk is %11, which is a bad business in my book.  "
17	You still aren't good enough for me (2nd time)	I'm simply not impressed.  Your reputation is but %11.  I won't talk to you unless it improves.	"The stories I hear about you are %11, but that isn't good enough.  Be on your way."	"Ah, %02.  Until the rumors and gossip about you grow more positive, I don't want to talk to you. "	"Persons of quality are not telling me that you are a person of quality.  Since I only deal with people whose reputations are %12 or better, we have nothing further to talk about."	%02.  Your reputation suffers.  Prolonged association with the likes of you imperils the purity of my aura.  I don't want to speak with you.	"<sigh>  Though your reputation is at least %11, I promised my mother that I wouldn't talk to people whose reputation wasn't at least %12.  Sorry."	%13!  Maybe someday I will have something to say to you!  Maybe.  But not until your reputation improves.	"My dear %02.  You must tend to your soul before I can attend to your needs.  Go, and return only when your feet are more firmly on the righteous path."	I will only associate with people who won't embarrass me!  You will.  Maybe if people start telling me your reputation is %12.  Until then…	I can't talk to you.  I know your reputation is only %11. It must be better.  Orders.  Sorry.	Everyone in my secret cult tells me that you aren't nice enough to be with.  So go get nicer and I'll start talking to you.	"Hmm.  %02.  I have sworn an oath to avoid those of ill repute.  Your reputation is %11, which is beneath me.  Perhaps if it improves..."	"My friends all tell me your reputation is %11, %02.  That's not good enough!  Perhaps a good deed or two would make your presence more acceptable to civilized society."
18	You still aren't bad enough for me (2nd time)	Your reputation is just too pure for me.  I don't like it.  It's not right.  Maybe if I heard some more bad gossip about you we could talk.  Until then…	"I can sense goodness upon you, %02.  Bring yourself down to %11, and then return to me."	"Look, all my friends are uncertain about trusting you.  Until you do something to earn our faith, something illegal, I just can't be seen with you.  It makes me look bad."	"I just can't trust you.  Maybe if your reputation were to fall to %11, or worse we could talk.  <bowing> Until then %10."	"Your aura lacks the mottled purple and yellow spots I must see before I am allowed to speak with you.  You must do more evil, %02, before we can safely talk."	Your reputation is only %12!  I can't be seen with you.  Everyone I know would laugh at me!  I only associate with people whose reputation is %11 or worse.	"%13!  You've returned!  Returned with a reputation of %11…Hmmm.  Looks wimpy to me.  Do something to impress me, 'cause I don't associate with the weak, or the helpless.  Until then, take off, eh?"	"%02, your personal darkness is shot through with streaks of light.  I won't have it!  I refuse to deal with the uncommitted, the uncertain, and the weak!  Return to me after you have proven your evil and stained your soul!"	I retain doubts about your commitment to a life on the shady side.  I must hear that your reputation is %12 or less!  Otherwise I can have nothing to do with you!	I can't talk to you.  I know your reputation is only %11. It must be worse.  Orders.  Sorry.	"Your reputation isn't appropriate for my organization, %02, therefore I can't be seen talking to you.  Come back when your reputation has…improved."	"%02, your evil wavers.  More.  More I say!  You need to be at least %12 for me to want to talk to you, so get to work!  "	"I cannot believe you would enter my presence with a reputation of merely %11!  The insult is dire indeed, %10.  Leave, and return when your reputation is %12!"
19	I accept your beg	"Oh, all right.  But I really don't want to be seen with you.  Let's not make this a habit."	Your groveling has touched my heart.  I will talk to you for a moment.	n/a	n/a	<sigh> Very well.  But this is it for today!  I don't have time for you.	"Fine, but make it quick."	I suppose I could speak to you for a few minutes.  Hurry up.	"How could I not respond to such a piteous cry for help?  What do you require, %15?"	n/a	n/a	n/a	Hmmm.  All right.  But only because my mood is good.	Today I will grant your wish. I will speak with you.  Briefly.
20	I don't like begging	n/a	n/a	"I gave at the Guild.  I'm not interested. I'm broke.  It's not my problem.  Get a job.  I don't care…Don't you get it?  Go away, I don't want to talk to you!"	"What about me makes you think I care about you or your problems?  Begone, or I shall set the town guard on you."	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	Beg all you like.  I still won't help you.	<kicking at you> Get away from me!	I already told you I don't really care for you.  Bother someone else.	n/a	n/a
