3	item003	Keen Longsword	350	Weapon	Sword	3d3	6	8	6	Longsword	1	0	0	-2	118	"Although this longsword appears quite old, the edge of the blade is unusually sharp.  It was quite probably enchanted to remain that way during its creation."
4	item004	Graceful Sword	500	Weapon	Sword	3d3	9	8	9	Longsword	1	0	0	4	138	"An high quality longsword, monogrammed initials near the base of the pommel indicate it was forged by master weaponsmith Mekorig the Blind circa 780-800."

7	item007	Great Sword	500	Weapon2	Sword	4d5	2	8	6	Two-Handed Sword	2	0	0	16	142	"An effective, deadly design employed by less well disciplined armies throughout time.  The smith of this particular two-handed sword thoughtfully added a blood groove down the center of the blade."
8	item008	Heroic Sword	800	Weapon2	Sword	4d5	8	8	10	Two-Handed Sword	2	0	0	14	139	"It is thought by some master swordsmen that a wavy blade is a bit stronger than a straight one, and does more damage when it strikes an opponent.  That may or may not be true, but one thing is certain--this particular sword's craftsmanship is amongst the finest you've ever seen."
9	item009	Broadsword	100	Weapon	Sword	3d4	0	8	1	Broadsword	3	0	0	6	128	A polished broadsword commonly used by all forces in Erathia.

11	item011	Champion Sword	600	Weapon	Sword	3d4	10	8	9	Broadsword	3	0	0	2	123	"More a falchion than a broadsword, this magnificent weapon retains a keen edge in spite of its age."
12	item012	Cutlass	40	Weapon	Sword	2d4	0	7	1	Cutlass	4	0	0	6	98	The swept-back style of the cutlass helps opponents underestimate the weapon's true reach.  Many unexperienced swordsmen have lost their lives to this deceptive design.
13	item013	Goblin Cutlass	290	Weapon	Sword	2d4	5	7	5	Cutlass	4	0	0	0	109	"A strange mix of brass and some other, reddish metal provide this weapon with its strange color and unusual strength.  Goblin craftsman are typically unconcerned with appearance, but when it comes to killing, they can be counted on to get it right.  "
14	item014	Regnan Cutlass	590	Weapon	Sword	2d4	11	7	9	Cutlass	4	0	0	4	118	"Cleverly concealed initials near the pommel of this cutlass prove this beautiful weapon to be the work of Alec Teling, master smith to Hareck IX, Lord of Regna, and emperor of the Endless Ocean."

16	item016	Dwarven Dagger	100	Weapon	Dagger	2d2	2	6	2	Dagger	5	0	0	7	71	"More like a short sword to a dwarf, this dagger is an excellent example of superior dwarven engineering and inferior artistic creativity."
17	item017	Sharktooth Dagger	150	Weapon	Dagger	2d2	3	6	4	Dagger	5	0	0	14	54	The 'blade' of this dagger is really a sharks' tooth taken from the waters of the Quiet Ocean and mounted on a fancy handle.  It is very sharp and light.
18	item018	Assassin's Dagger	250	Weapon	Dagger	2d2	5	6	6	Dagger	5	0	0	14	67	The crosspiece of this dagger folds in to make concealment easier.  A spring in the pommel snaps the crosspiece out very quietly when the dagger is drawn from its sheath.

21	item021	Erathian Long Dagger	200	Weapon	Dagger	2d3	4	7	4	Long Dagger	5	0	0	4	81	"Really more of a short sword than a dagger, the narrow blade belies an unusual strength and a possibly enchanted edge."
22	item022	Exquisite Long Dagger	350	Weapon	Dagger	2d3	7	7	8	Long Dagger	5	0	0	10	84	"The spare, yet appealing design of this long dagger is typical of pre-Silence artifacts.

23	item023	Crude Axe	30	Weapon	Axe	4d2	0	5	1	Axe	7	0	0	17	82	This primitive axe is more like a simple tool than a weapon.
24	item024	Battle Axe	100	Weapon	Axe	4d2	2	5	3	Axe	7	0	0	19	86	The flared edge of the blade is a common style used by low budget human armies and bandits.
25	item025	Dwarven Axe	250	Weapon	Axe	4d2	5	5	6	Axe	7	0	0	28	100	"Typical Dwarven manufacture:  Strong, practical, and plain."
26	item026	Steel Axe	400	Weapon	Axe	4d2	8	5	9	Axe	7	0	0	15	120	"One of several crates full of such axes stolen from the Dwarves by the Warlocks of Nighon.  Each of these weapons has been tempered and enchanted by the Stone City foundry, and stamped with their mark."

30	item030	Headsman's Poleaxe	900	Weapon2	Axe	3d7	9	5	9	Two-Handed Axe	8	0	0	20	170	"So named for the execution device favored by headsmen, the Headsman's Poleaxe sports a longer blade to reduce messy and embarassing execution mistakes.  "
31	item031	Crude Spear	15	Weapon1or2	Spear	1d9	0	6	1	Spear	9	0	0	0	141	"Though constructed with a head of sharpened rock lashed to a rough stick, this spear can cause serious damage. (+1D9 if used two-handed)."

33	item033	Elven Spear	250	Weapon1or2	Spear	1d9	5	6	6	Spear	9	0	0	0	133	"Elven weapons are almost always as graceful as they are practical.  The spear's style and elegance have not come at the expense of practical qualities such as the sturdy attachement of head to haft, nor the choices of metal and haft grip."
34	item034	Cruel Spear	450	Weapon1or2	Spear	1d9	9	6	9	Spear	9	0	0	7	135	The triangular shape of the spear head leads to especially painful wounds that do not heal easily or well.  Runic enchantments inscribed along the haft suggest enchantments that enhance the cruel effect of the triangular head.

36	item036	Halberd	200	Weapon1or2	Spear	3d6	0	6	1	Halberd	10	0	0	29	141	"Like all Halberds, this weapon is basically an axe with a very long haft.  It's a versatile weapon--doubling as a spear when fighting room is tight, or a staff when personal defense is needed.  This one is of ordinary worksmanship and materials."
37	item038	Weighted Halberd	400	Weapon1or2	Spear	3d6	4	6	5	Halberd	10	0	0	28	141	"The haft of this halberd has been cored, and filled with a lead rod.  When the weapon is swung, the lead rod slides to the blade end of the halberd with a loud crack, adding force and weight to the blow."
38	item037	Mighty Halberd	700	Weapon1or2	Spear	3d6	10	6	9	Halberd	10	0	0	28	140	"A small stamp on the blade of this weapon indicates it was constructed in the famous Mekorig Foundry by the master himself, Mekorig the Blind.  You would be hard pressed to find a finer Halberd anywhere in the world "

40	item040	Barbed Trident	400	Weapon1or2	Spear	2d6	6	6	5	Trident	11	0	0	9	142	"Improving on the basic trident design, the tips of the tines have rough, backwards facing barbs.  This designs causes much more damage as the weapon is pulled from the victim."
41	item041	War Trident	700	Weapon1or2	Spear	2d6	12	6	9	Trident	11	0	0	18	139	"A style favored by the Imerial Regnan Navy, the two side tines of the war trident are thin and sharp to make slashing as easy as stabbing.  To further impress enemies, the tines are gilded in brass, and the haft painted yellow, giving the appearance that the Regnans are fighting with golden weapons."

46	item046	Griffin Bow	500	Missile	Bow	5d2	8	3	12	Longbow	12	0	0	12	40	"The grisly materials used in this bow--a griffin's skull and tough spine--make for a surprisingly tough and powerful bow.  Needless to say, the materials are hard to harvest, and griffins fight back much harder than Yew trees."
47	item047	Crossbow	50	Missile	Bow	4d2	0	4	1	Crossbow	13	0	0	12	10	"Although crossbows have many advantages--locking string catches, superior shot strength, easy to learn--they don't compare to the longbow when speed and range are critical.  "
48	item048	Heavy Crossbow	200	Missile	Bow	4d2	3	4	5	Crossbow	13	0	0	12	10	"These crossbows were stockpiled by Archibald just prior to the Succession War for use against his brother.  As with most decisions involving death, Archibald chose wisely.  These crossbows are amongst the best in the land."
49	item049	Ideal Crossbow	400	Missile	Bow	4d2	7	4	9	Crossbow	13	0	0	26	10	"Equipped with a hand crank and shaft sights, these exceptional crossbows are superior to all that have come before.  Just where they are coming from is a mystery at this time…"
50	item050	Mace	50	Weapon	Mace	2d4	0	6	1	Mace	14	0	0	6	95	"Barely more sophisticated than a normal club, the mace is slightly more effective and much more durable."

52	item052	Zealot Mace	300	Weapon	Mace	2d4	5	6	6	Mace	14	0	0	12	94	"A common mace from Karigor, it displays the same superior quality of all weapons and equipment from that island."
53	item053	Dwarven Morningstar	450	Weapon	Mace	2d4	8	6	9	Mace	14	0	0	1	67	"A variation of the mace, the morningstar hits slower but much harder.  The spikes on the ball guarantee recipients will feel the blow, regardless of armor or hide."
54	item054	Supreme Flail	600	Weapon	Mace	2d4	11	6	12	Mace	14	0	0	1	78	"A heavier, more menacing weapon than a morningstar, flails are almost as dangerous to their wielder as they are to opponents.  Flails like this one are of the highest quality, thoroughly enchanted by the Warlock Guild of Nighon."
55	item055	Hammer	120	Weapon	Mace	2d5	0	6	1	Hammer	15	0	0	11	71	"A crude, tool-like weapon, this hammer includes a wrist chain to prevent it from dropping from your hand."
56	item056	War Hammer	300	Weapon	Mace	2d5	3	6	5	Hammer	15	0	0	19	98	"A step up in construction quality, these hammers are commonly wielded by humanoid monsters.  Since everyone knows most monsters don't make weapons, the question 'from where are they getting them?' arises…"
57	item057	Dwarven Hammer	600	Weapon	Mace	2d5	9	6	9	Hammer	15	0	0	19	88	"The top of the line for the hammer family of weapons.  This Dwarven hammer was constructed in the forges of Stone City, and every feature is perfect--balance, weight, handle material, head construction--all the best possible with modern metalurgical techniques."
58	item058	Club	1	Weapon	Club	1d3	0	3	0	Club	16	0	0	5	121	A primitive weapon usable by even the stupidest of monsters.  This club is constructed of Erathian oak.
59	item059	Spiked Club	40	Weapon	Club	1d3	3	3	2	Club	16	0	0	3	87	"An improvement over the simple club, this spiked club will inflict nastier wounds."
60	item060	Steel club	100	Weapon	Club	1d3	5	3	4	Club	16	0	0	7	100	"The symmetry and length of the knob at the end of the club is the only feature that distinguishes this club from a mace.  The balance is good, the construction is solid, but it IS still a club, and you can't expect that much from it.  Probably of Goblin manufacture."
61	item061	Staff	40	Weapon2	Staff	2d4	0	3	1	Staff	17	0	0	1	115	The staff is the common weapon of the oppressed.
62	item062	Iron Core Staff	250	Weapon2	Staff	2d4	3	3	5	Staff	17	0	0	2	101	"This staff has been filled with iron to give a harder punch than an ordinary staff, while appearing to be nothing more than a fancy walking stick.  The wood is polished Ash, carved with a tasteful design."
63	item063	Wizard Staff	500	Weapon2	Staff	2d4	7	3	9	Staff	17	0	0	3	96	"A weird combination of wood, glass and aluminum form the staff, while a crystalline skull tops it.  The whole weapon is bound together with glue and strong enchantments to make one of the lightest, strongest staves in the world."
64	item064	Blaster	0	Weapon	Blaster	3d5	8	10	30	Ancient Weapon	18	0	0	-2	12	"A weapon of awesome power, almost certainly created during the Time of Wonders.  "
65	item065	Blaster Rifle	0	Weapon	Blaster	5d5	12	10	30	Ancient Weapon	19	0	0	1	64	"The finest of personal weapons made during the Time of Wonders, Blaster Rifles can deal death faster than any weapon you have ever seen."
66	item066	Leather Armor	150	Armor	Leather	4	0	3	1	Leather Armor	20	0	0	0	0	"Leather armor is the lightest and most easily worn armor, but it offers less protection that the heavier armors.  The leather in this suit was improperly cured and still stinks of the chemicals used in its production."
67	item067	Studded Leather	250	Armor	Leather	4	2	3	4	Leather Armor	20	0	0	0	0	"This suit of leather armor is held together with bronze studs instead of leather straps.  This construction makes it a bit stronger, but also a bit heavier."
68	item068	Officer's Leather	450	Armor	Leather	4	6	3	8	Leather Armor	20	0	0	0	0	"An otherwise ordinary suit of leather armor, this suit is imbued with a subtle enchantment that strengthens the material against blows without increasing weight."
69	item069	Regnan Leather	750	Armor	Leather	4	12	3	10	Leather Armor	20	0	0	0	0	Standard issue leather armor for officers in the Regnan Navy.  All such leather armor receives enchantments to strengthen and lighten it during its creation in the Regnan Armories.
70	item070	Royal Leather	1150	Armor	Leather	4	20	3	12	Leather Armor	20	0	0	0	0	"Only a few suits like this one have been made, and all were special orders for members of the royal family of Erathia--the Gryphonhearts.  This one had to come from one of three places:  Stolen from the palace armory, taken on the battlefield, or robbed from a grave."
71	item071	Chain Mail	400	Armor	Chain	8	0	6	1	Chain Mail	21	0	0	0	0	"Chain mail is an armor formed of small, interlocking loops of metal.  It looks like someone forgot to oil the rings, or maybe left it out in the rain because rust has begun to form in the armpits and under the collars."
72	item072	Steel Chain Mail	600	Armor	Chain	8	4	6	5	Chain Mail	21	0	0	0	0	"This suit of chain mail is made of steel and is actually lighter than similar suits made of plain iron.  Thin rings were used in its construction, but the steel composition makes them very strong."
73	item073	Fine Chain Mail	900	Armor	Chain	8	10	6	10	Chain Mail	21	0	0	0	0	Very high quality steel is reinforced with fine studded leather to soften blows while minimizing weight.  The leather portions are quite artistic and pleasing to the eye.
74	item074	Resplendent Chain Mail	1300	Armor	Chain	8	18	6	15	Chain Mail	21	0	0	0	0	"A distinctive suit of armor meant to aid recognition of officers during battle.  Besides just looking good, the armor is amongst the lightest, most supple chain mail available.  "

The armor was originally worn strictly by the Governor's highest military officers as a badge of office.  It is not just for show; this chain mail is lighter, stronger, and more supple than any other chain in the world."
76	item076	Plate Armor	1000	Armor	Plate	20	0	9	1	Plate Armor	22	0	0	0	0	"Plate armor is the strongest armor available.  It is much heavier than other suits of armor, and requires considerable practice to get used to wearing.  This suit is made of iron, and the workmanship is unremarkable."
77	item077	Splendid Plate Armor	1400	Armor	Plate	20	8	9	8	Plate Armor	22	0	0	0	0	"Forged in an Erathian armory, this suit of plate armor bears a recent stamp:  B.R., Steadwick Foundry, 1151.  The initials are those of Byron Rockermann, Royal armorsmith of Erathia.  His work is competent and elegant."
78	item078	Noble Plate Armor	2700	Armor	Plate	20	34	9	20	Plate Armor	22	0	0	0	0	"A suit of armor so fine could only have come from the forge of the Master himself--Mekorig the Blind.  Indeed, this one bears the initials of his son, Kasev Mekorig near the heel.  The joints move easily, and the metal has a curious triple plated construction that makes it thin and light, yet incredibly strong.  Padding in comfortable, too."
79	item079	Goblin Shield	200	Shield	Shield	6	0	4	1	Large Shield	23	0	0	56	73	"A simple, old shield with crude markings on its face.  Ugly, but practical."

81	item081	Horseman's Shield	400	Shield	Shield	6	3	4	8	Large Shield	23	0	0	56	90	"Narrow and tapered at the bottom, this shield is intended for battle on horseback, but will work just fine on foot.  Construction is tight and materials are tough--it should be able to resist a direct spear thrust."
82	item082	Sterling Shield	500	Shield	Shield	6	7	4	12	Large Shield	23	0	0	61	95	"Made of a lightweight metal, this shield has a foundry stamp from the Kelebrim armory.  Though light, the material is very strong, and the metal is welded almost seamlessly.  "
83	item083	Phynaxian Shield	800	Shield	Shield	6	13	4	16	Large Shield	23	0	0	65	90	"These shields were forged by the Phynaxian empire during its brief rise to power on the steppes of southern Erathia (790-864).  They are made of stalt, a metal that takes well to enchantment, and contributed heavily to Phynaxian military might.  Unfortunately, very little of the metal could be mined, and Phynaxia fell in 864 A.S. to an Elvish offensive."
84	item084	Wooden Buckler	100	Shield	Shield	4	0	4	1	Small Shield	24	0	0	25	25	"A small wood buckler designed to protect against arrows without encumbering its wielder.  The quality is amaturish, but it's in good condition and will serve its purpose."

86	item086	Metal Shield	300	Shield	Shield	4	4	4	8	Small Shield	24	0	0	63	60	"The pretty red design on the surface of this shield means it's from Deyja, and the paint isn't paint.  Emulsifiers and preservatives help to retain the original color…"
87	item087	Alloyed Shield	450	Shield	Shield	4	8	4	12	Small Shield	24	0	0	55	55	The exact mixture of metals in these strong shields has been lost for hundreds of years.  Attempts to rediscover the process used to make them have been miserable failures.  There is absolutely nothing enchanted or magical about these shields--any enchantment they carry was added after they were created.  
88	item088	Majestic Shield	750	Shield	Shield	4	14	4	16	Small Shield	24	0	0	55	55	"The dark, golden color of these shields is actually a flaw.  About fifty of these shields were turned out by the Heavenly Forge as it began to fail.  Although imperfect, they are second only to shields built by the Forge in its prime."
89	item089	Horned Helm	60	Helm	Misc	2	0	6	1	Helm	25	0	0	0	20	"This cheap helm is better suited for a costume party than a battle.  The horns have been glued onto a rigid leather cap dyed black to make it look scarier.  The material is brittle and flaky, and will probably come apart at just the wrong time."

It is said that an object may take so much enchantment--try to put too much in, and something negative squeezes out.  In this case, the negative made the wearer profoundly unlucky.  Taledon, arguably the most powerful figure of his time, veteran diplomat, soldier, and priest, was crushed beneath the wheels of a runaway peasant's wagon while crossing the street in Steadwick."
