Class	Descriptions	Notes

They are also the least physically powerful class, and can use the smallest selection of weapons and armor."	Necromancer

Cleric	"Clerics are adventuring, spell casting holy men. Before they leave the sanctity of their orders, clerics learn basic fighting skills and a smattering of useful healing spells.

They are fair fighters, but are limited to the lighter armors and can only melee with blunt weapons."	Cleric
