191	History holds that Lizardmen temples of this period were guarded by traps and not monsters. What then to make of the reptilian slithering receding into the darkness?	Abandoned Temple
192	The smell of freshly lumbered wood gives indication of this fort's recent construction. The large stacks of supplies show that the Regnan pirates are planning a lengthy stay.	Pirate Outpost
193	"Even in the freeport of Ravenshore, some goods must avoid official eyes. Such usually pass through this secluded cove in the care of the wererat smugglers."	Smuggler's Cove

197	"The hive emits a hum which sets your teeth rattling in your jaw. The breeze you feel is not the wind, but the blowback of a thousand monstrous wings."	Wasp Nest
198	Ogre armies need carry no winches to their fort building sites. Their strength of arm and back is sufficient to raise the massive beams and posts.	Ogre Raiding Fort
199	The Trolls of Rust have entombed their dead here for centuries--each generation digging deeper catacombs beneath those dug before.	Troll Tomb
200	"What use do the Cyclopes make of this sinister vault? Whatever they do, makes it smell like a butcher's shop."	Cyclops Larder

205	Though this temple is newly built it already possesses a timeless quality.	Temple of the Sun
206	The dark rock of these stone monuments cannot be found nearby. The nearest source is the Shadowspire Mountains a hundred leagues away.	Abandoned Druid Circle

208	Zog the Jackal's preference for building on high ground has provided an unexpected boon in the form of protection from the raging flood waters.	Barbarian Fortress
209	The Regnans have never been known for their subtlety. This thick walled and cannon studded castle is the very definition of 'forbidding.'	Pirate Stronghold
210	"From a distance, this moss covered and crumbling stronghold seems long abandoned. Fresh boot prints in the mud and the signal mirror tell a different story."	Abandoned Pirate Keep
211	This strange craft seems capable of traveling both on and under the water's surface. A series of cranks operated the wheel of blades which propel it.	Hand-Cranked Submarine
212	"Brooding over the village below, the Necromancers' Guild exudes an atmosphere of domineering evil."	Necromancers' Guild
213	"Though renown for her beauty, Zanthora's madness drives her to live apart from the company of others. In this forbidding castle she conducts her dark experiments."	Mad Necromancer's Lab
214	All buildings in the Plane of Air float. So why does this cloud castle seem particularly incongruous? Perhaps because its great size?	Castle of Air
215	Tribute Tomb	Tribute Tomb
216	Not a stick of wood or other combustibles are visible in the walls and towers of this mighty keep of stone and iron.	Castle of Fire
217	"If there were any doubts of the Fire Elementals' hostile intentions towards Jadame, they are allayed by the presence of this rallying camp. "	War Camp

220	"Though the view is obscured by shimmering waves of heated air, through the gateway you perceive a hellish landscape of endless bridgeways spanning an ocean of lava."	Gateway to the Plane of Fire
221	The gateway leads to an earthen tunnel which extends a few paces then tees off left and right. You can't say where the passages lead.	Gateway to the Plane of Earth
222	You see no solid ground in the airy realm through this gateway. In the hazy distance you can see oddly shaped buildings that seem to float in the sky.	Gateway to the Plane of Air
223	Looking through the gateway is like peering through a window into an underwater canyon. Creatures of all sizes swim menacingly in the distance.	Gateway to the Plane of Water
