272	"You are employed by the Merchants of Alvar, yes? Well, I think you should speak with Dadeross, the leader of your caravan. My far seeing vision tells me he is on the Dagger Wound Islands."	seer
273	"Hmmm…I cannot look too far ahead--for the ether is thick today. All I see is that you must deliver the letter Dadeross gave you to the merchant, Elgar Fellmoon. Fellmoon lives in the city of Ravenshore."	seer
274	"I see a vision of you in which you take a letter from Elgar Fellmoon in Ravenshore to Arion Hunter, the leader of the Ravenshore smugglers. After this, you return to Fellmoon. The end of the vision is a blur, so you must not have lived entirely through it. Still, it is your fate to do these things."	seer
275	"I don't need my vision to tell me what you must do next. Do as Fellmoon asked of you. Go seek Bastian Loudrin, the guildmaster of the Alvarian Merchant Guild. He is in the city of Alvar."	seer
276	I see an important connection has not been made between the present and your future. You must return to Bastian Loudrin and continue your conversations with him. He will send you on the next step down your road.	seer
277	"In my dreams last night, I saw you traveling to the Ironsand Desert to find a witness to the formation of a great lake of fire which formed there during the cataclysm."	seer
278	"It is clear to me that you must bring the Troll, Overdune, to the merchant guild in Alvar."	seer
279	"I see far through space today, but not through time. A great disaster has befallen the Minotaurs of Balthazar Lair in Ravage Roaming. I feel that your destiny is linked with their fate. You must rescue them from their peril."	seer
280	"There is great turmoil in the Balance. It has taken me some time to know its source, but I know it now. It is caused by the war between the clerics of the Temple of the Sun located in Murmurwoods, and the Necromancers' Guild of Shadowspire. It is your destiny to undo the turmoil by choosing one of these two to ally with."	seer
281	"There is great turmoil in the Balance. It has taken me some time to know its source, but I know it now. There is conflict between the Dragons and Knights who fight in Garrote Gorge. It is your destiny to ally with one of the two at the expense of the other."	seer
282	You have done good work in forging the alliances you have. It is now time for you to seek the council of those allies you have brought together. Seek them out in their council chamber within the merchant guild in Ravenshore.	seer
283	I see an important connection has not been made between the present and your future destiny. You must return to the council chamber in the Ravenshore merchant guild. The councilors will send you on the next step down your road.	seer
284	You must do as the alliance council has asked of you. Find a way to Regna Island and sink the Regnan port fleet.	seer
285	"In case you haven't heard, Ravenshore is under attack by the Regnan pirates. The town has been evacuated. You must eliminate the pirate threat before the alliance council will return to guide you."	seer
286	Now that you've sunk the Regnan fleet. Go and seek the wisdom of your alliance council. They will give you the next task that will make your destiny.	seer
287	"You must speak to the Ironfists' court sage, Xanthor. He is housed in Ravenshore."	seer
288	"I see an important link between the present and your future has not been forged. Seek out the sage, Xanthor who resides in Ravenshore. He will send you on your destiny's next task."	seer
289	"It is clear that you must do as Xanthor has asked of you. Go to the four elemental planes and find in each, an elemental heartstone."	seer
290	"Now that you have the four elemental heartstones, you must now bring them to Xanthor in Ravenshore."	seer
291	Your destiny lies through the crystal gateway in Ravenshore. It will take you to the Plane Between Planes. There you will find the source of the elemental cataclysm.	seer
292	"You have talked to the Destroyer, but have failed to gather from him the key which will unlock your future. Return to him and continue your conversations."	seer
293	Your path is clear to my vision. You must seek out the four elemental lords and release them from their prisons. These prisons are in the Destroyer's realm--the Plane Between Planes.	seer
294	"Seek out Xanthor! Though he is but a piece in the game of Balance, the next move you make towards destiny it through a meeting with him."	seer
295	"The Balance is restored. Now that your destiny is made, I can no longer guide you--my sight only pertains to what is connected to the fate of Balance. What you do now is up to you. Good luck to you, Heroes of Jadame!"	seer
