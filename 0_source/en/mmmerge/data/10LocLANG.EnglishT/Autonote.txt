243	You have done good work in forging the alliances you have. It is now time for you to seek the council of those allies you have brought together. Seek them out in their council chamber within the merchant guild in Ravenshore.	seer

251	"Now that you have the four elemental heartstones, you must now bring them to Xanthor in Ravenshore."	seer		
252	Your destiny lies through the crystal gateway in Ravenshore. It will take you to the Plane Between Planes. There you will find the source of the elemental cataclysm.	seer		
253	"You have talked to the Destroyer, but have failed to gather from him the key which will unlock your future. Return to him and continue your conversations."	seer		
254	Your path is clear to my vision. You must seek out the four elemental lords and release them from their prisons. These prisons are in the Destroyer's realm--the Plane Between Planes.	seer		
255	"Seek out Xanthor! Though he is but a piece in the game of Balance, the next move you make towards destiny it through a meeting with him."	seer		
256	"The Balance is restored. Now that your destiny is made, I can no longer guide you--my sight only pertains to what is connected to the fate of Balance. What you do now is up to you. Good luck to you, Heroes of Jadame!"	seer
