Take heart that your children's children will live in a perfect world free of war, free of famine, and free of fear.  Remember your sacred duty to care for the Ship on her long Voyage and ensure her safe arrival in the Promised Land.  Tend well the Guardian and house it securely away from the ship lest both be lost in a single misfortune."	你绞尽脑汁，终于破译了这些象形文字：
尽管横渡虚空的旅途漫长艰险，但最终你会找到一个未受先人或敌人破坏的乐土，你的子孙将居住在一个没有战争饥荒恐惧的完美世界中。记住，你神圣的使命是在漫长旅途中尽心看护此船，确保能安全抵达许诺之地。还要照顾好守护者，使他远离船舰，以免一次事故同时毁掉船和守护者。
location	"With painstaking care, you are able to decipher the message of the hieroglyphs, intermixed with diagrams of devils:                                                                                          Remember our Enemy, children, and never underestimate the danger they pose.  Though you will never see one during your journey, you must be forever vigilant against invasion from the Void once the Voyage has ended.  Mighty beyond words, the Enemy is nonetheless vulnerable after a Crossing, for their numbers are small and their defenses weak.  Use the energy weapons carried on the Ship to defeat them, and never, ever engage the Enemy with lesser weapons, or you will surely perish."	你绞尽脑汁，终于破译了这些象形文字及魔鬼小人状插图：
孩子们，千万要小心敌人，永远不要低估它们的危害。就算旅途中你看不到敌人，到达目的地后，你依然必须时刻保持警惕，提防来自虚空的入侵。不过，强大的敌人在横渡之后数量少防御弱。你可以用船上的能量武器打败它们，千万别拿比这弱的武器，这是自取灭亡。
location	"Chief Engineer Wilson’s Personal Log.  I have locked myself in Storage Room #6 but currently have no means of escape.  The drone-bots have gone mad and have started killing everyone in sight.  I was able to access the main control terminal on Level Four despite warnings of a hazardous leak, and I sent a distress signal, but since we have not had contact with any of the colonies for several weeks, I do not believe that a rescue is possible.  I have also managed to seal this facility so that the drones can not escape.  It is my hope that the colonists will be able to mount some sort of defense by the time my encryption codes are broken.  Tell Emma I love her.  Wilson out."	总工程师威尔森的个人日志：我把自己锁在6号储藏室，现无法逃脱。飞行机器人疯了，见人就杀。我不顾有害物泄露的警告，去第4层主控制终端发出了求援，但我们和任何殖民星都已失联数周，救援无望。我还设法把整个设施封了起来，以防飞行机器人逃出。望殖民星人在密码被破解前设置防御。告诉艾玛我爱她。威尔森绝笔。
