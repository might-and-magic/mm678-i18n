npc conversation	"In addition to my duties as overseer of unlicensed business, I am the High Priest of Enroth.  It is my job to promote clerics to priests, and if warranted, priests to priests of light.  Right now, the rolls are full of priests, and I am unable to promote new ones without creating new positions.  To do so would be highly irregular, but if someone were to perform an extraordinary service for the kingdom, the promotion would be acceptable.  <Rubbing his temples> Come to think of it, there is a service I need.  A temple in Free Haven was destroyed by fire a few months ago.  If you could get it rebuilt, I would have a reason to promote any clerics among you to priest status.  Since I really want this job done, I am even willing to promote non-priests to an honorary priest status, and I will pay you well for your service.  You’ll need to hire a stonecutter and a carpenter and show them the temple you want them to work on."	我是非法行业的监管人兼恩洛斯的大主教。负责牧师至神甫和神甫至光明主教的升迁。现在神甫的名额满了，没有空缺，我无法补充新人。但如果有人为王国立下奇功，可以得到破格提升。<摩挲着神庙>现在就有一个机会。几个月前，自由天堂的一处神庙被烈火所毁。如果你们能重建神庙，我就可以把你们之中的牧师升级为神甫，其他人授于荣誉神甫职位，并付给你们一大笔酬金。你需要雇一个石匠和一个木匠，并告诉他们如何重建神庙。
npc conversation	"It seems a bit quick to promote anyone to high priests, given that the promotion to priest has been so recent.  Why, many wait their entire lives to receive such a promotion, only to be granted it posthumously.  However, an extraordinary service could possibly accelerate that promotion to, well, right now for instance?and I do have such a service in mind.  The heretical monks that live on the islands east of Free Haven have stolen our sacred chalice.  Retrieve it from the monks and put it in the temple you rebuilt.  Then return to me."	刚提升为神父，就想再升为光明主教，这未免太仓促了些。许多人为得到这一职位等了一生，死后方才如愿以偿。除非你立下惊天动地的大功劳。现在倒有件现成的。一个邪教僧侣偷走了圣杯，他就住在自由天堂东边的小岛上。如果你能把圣杯夺回来，放入你修好的神庙内，就能被提升为光明主教。
npc conversation	"You are successful!  It looks like I will have to keep my promise and make more irregular, early promotions.  I do so with pleasure.  I hereby promote all priests to high priests, and all honorary priests to honorary high priests."	干得好极了！我将履行我的诺言，将你们破格提升。你们中的神父将被提升为大主教，荣誉神父提升为荣誉大主教。

npc conversation	"Your training does not end with what you have learned as a wizard, one final step remains.  Master wizard status completes your mastery of elemental magic.  Building on your wizard training, master wizards have vast magical ability– the most efficient and skilled use of magic anywhere.  Earning this training requires a powerful artifact, owned by the powerful Arch Mage Drael-.. no, it was Frundir-… no, that’s not right either.  Actually, I can’t seem to remember what the artifact was or who owned it.  I'd remember it if I saw it, though.  I know it can be found in Corlagon’s Estate near the Mire of the Damned.  Search for it there and return it; I must have it to train you to become a master wizard."	你的法术修炼并非到此为止。还有最后一项。只有修炼到魔法大师才能把元素魔法融会贯通。根据你魔法师修炼的基础，魔法大师将拥有超人一等的法力。他能随时随地纯熟运用各项魔法有效攻击对手。要修炼为大法师必须有一个威力强大的宝物。它在伟法力无边的首席魔法师德里尔那里。不对，不对。在弗伦德尔那里，不对，也不对。我实在记不起宝物什么样，属于谁了。但我记得我见过它。它在幽灵沼泽附近的考勒根的豪宅里。到那儿看看，把它带回来。有了它，我才能把你训练成魔法大师。
npc conversation	"Great news!  I remember what you need to find!  The Crystal of Terrax!  Oh, you seem to have found it already.  Well, perfect!  I can train you to master wizards, then.  The first arch mage, Terrax, used this Crystal to master the elements.  Fire, earth, water, and air all formed together to make it, and from analyzing it he learned a great deal about elemental magic.  In addition, its effect on light led him to his discoveries of light and dark magic.  Since that time, the study of this crystal has guided every new master wizard.  Let me show you the secrets of the crystal. "	好消息，我想起你该找什么了。是德里克斯水晶。哦，你已经找到了。好极了。我可以训练你成为魔法大师了。首位大法师德里克斯就是用这块水晶来钻研元素魔法的。火，土，水，空气是元素魔法的四个要素，通过分析它们的构成就可练成此魔法。而且，德里克斯通过该魔法对光的作用而发现了光明魔法和暗黑魔法。自从那时起，每个新的魔法大师在水晶的指引下不断钻研。让我向你展示水晶的秘密，大法师。
npc conversation	"20 years ago, I won the annual archery competition held at Castle Ironfist, and I have held the championship ever since.  This gives me the right to promote archers to the title of warrior mage and master archer as I see fit.  I’ll grant the title of warrior mage to all the archers amongst you if you do me a little favor. I need the key to the old Dragon Towers set up near every major settlement in Enroth to shoot down flying creatures.  I think that they can be set to shoot down only monsters, instead of shooting anything flying through the air. Since this is something of a pet project, I will reward honorary warrior mage status to the rest of you.  The key is in my old keep near the southern entrance to my lands.  I had to leave it there when the ogres and their companions took it from me a few years ago.  Return with that key and be rewarded.  And I won’t be crying in my beer if you kill a lot of those monsters while you’re at it.  They took my keep!"	20年前，我在铁拳城堡举行的一年一度的弓箭手比武大会中赢得了冠军，因此我被授权负责弓箭手至高级射手，以及高级射手至神箭手的升迁。如果你们能帮我个小忙，我将把你们中的弓箭手升级为高级射手。我需要钥匙，进入建于恩洛斯各主要居民点附近的老龙塔，射杀飞行怪兽。我们只射怪兽，而不射空中的其他飞行物。因为此计划甚得人心，你们中非弓箭手者将被授予荣誉高级射手职位。钥匙就在我的领土南面入口附近的旧堡垒里，前些年食人妖和同伙从我这里把钥匙抢走了。你去把钥匙夺回来，我会奖励你的。你在那里对付这些怪兽不必心慈手软，他们抢走了我的了望所，罪有应得。
npc conversation	"Very good!  You got the key, and hopefully slew a large number of those loathsome beasts.  I hereby promote all archers to the status of warrior mage, and all non-archers to honorary warrior mage."	很好，你拿到钥匙了，一定把那些讨厌的怪兽杀个精光吧。我把你们所有弓箭手提升为高级射手，非弓箭手者授予荣誉高级射手职位。
npc conversation	"The reason I wanted the key was to open the Dragon Towers and make the adjustments to prevent them from shooting flyers indiscriminately.  There is a way to adjust the towers to shoot at only large objects, and I want all of them adjusted for the good of the Kingdom.  Magic is becoming more common, as are stories of young Sorcerers getting shot from the sky because they didn’t know the function of the towers.  You have the key.  If you adjust all of the towers to shoot at only large objects, I will promote all warrior mages amongst you to master archers and promote any honorary warrior mages to honorary master archers."	我要钥匙来进入龙塔的目的是为了阻止他们不分青红皂白，滥杀飞行生物。我们可以调节塔楼，使其只攻击大型怪兽。为了王国的利益，我要求所有的塔楼都要具有此项功能。由于一些修行不够的巫师们不知此塔楼的功能，他们常常遭到莫名其妙的攻击使魔法攻击力大减。现在你们有了钥匙。如果你们能使所有的塔楼只攻击大型飞行怪兽，我将把你们中的高级射手升级为神箭手。你们中的荣誉高级射手升级为荣誉神箭手。
npc conversation	"I knew my faith in you was well placed!  You have fixed a major problem in our kingdom, not to mention doing yourself a favor—It’s now safe to fly above towns.  It is my pleasure to promote all warrior mages to master archers, and all honorary warrior mages to honorary master archers.  "	我已经完全信任你了。你解决了我们王国最关键的问题，而且还毫不居功。现在我们可以自由地在城镇上空任意飞行了。我很荣幸把你们中的魔箭手升级为神箭手，荣誉魔箭手升级为荣誉神箭手。
npc conversation	"Welcome, master archers!  You may warm yourself by my hearth any time!"	欢迎你们，我的神箭手，我将始终和你们心心相印。
