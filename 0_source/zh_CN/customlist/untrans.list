npc conversation	Hey! Hey, you! Halt, I must speak with you for a spell. It’s a matter of an utmost importance. Though even ‘utmost’ can’t convey just how important the matter is. 
*The woman glances you over with a firm frown forming on her brow* 
How are you doing, by the way? Any sudden pains? Feeling strangely empty inside? Nothing? Well, that’s a relief, I have to say. Though I was pretty sure I had the hang of it by now. Third time’s the charm, aye?	嘿！嘿，就是你！站住，我必须和你说一个咒语。这件事至关重要。尽管即使“至关重要”也无法形容事情的重要性。
[这名女子紧皱眉头，向你瞥了一眼]
顺便问一下，你好吗？有突然的痛苦吗？感觉内心很空虚吗？没有？好吧，我必须说这是一种解脱。尽管我很确定自己现在已经拥有了，三倍的魅力，是吧？
npc conversation	Hey! Halt, I must speak with you for a spell. It’s a matter of an utmost importance.	嘿！站住，我必须和你说一个咒语。这件事至关重要。
npc conversation	Oh my, I'm so relieved to see you here! Something possibly terrible is afoot! Yes, I know, you've saved the world three times, but that means there's nobody else who can match you in skill and cunning, and boy, do we need skill and cunning! Possibly. Almost for certain, really.	哦，天哪，我很高兴在这里见到你！即将发生可怕的事情！是的，我知道，你拯救了世界三次，但这意味着没有其他人可以在技能和圆滑方面与你匹敌，孩子，我们需要技能和圆滑吗？可能需要，或者几乎肯定需要。
npc conversation	Hey, how's the expedition going? 	嘿，探险进展如何？
npc conversation	Pew pew pew! It looked easier than dealing with pesky goblins. But am I glad the Devil Queen is down! *Verdant shivers*. Disgusting thing. How did it smell? I don’t get full sensory experiences when using the spectator spells. 
It’s nice we get to see the slow rebuilding of the village of Sweet Water now. To have a place with such a name evoke fear in the people that hear it, it doesn’t sit well with me. 
And since we’re talking about things that don’t sit well with me, same can be said about you being knighted by a little boy you’ve had to fetch from the circus. I will never understand politics. Ever. In my eyes – you’re the world’s true royalty, and my chronicle will be sure to reflect that! Objectively, of course.
Oh, and this little thing is for you as well. So you don’t think I’m being lazy over here letting you do all the work.	嘿嘿嘿！看起来比讨厌的大耳怪要容易对付。我很高兴魔鬼女王倒下！[维尔丹作颤抖状]。真是恶心的东西。是不是有什么味道？我施展魔法时没有得到完整的感官体验。
很高兴看到甜水镇正在慢慢重建。一个这么美好的地名居然与恐怖联系在一起，这真让我坐立不安。
我们现在说的这些都是让我感到不快的事情，你们被一个被你们从马戏团拉回王宫的小男孩封为骑士这件事也是，我永远不理解政治，永远。在我看来，你们才是世界上真正的皇室成员，我的编年史一定会反映出这一点！当然，是客观地反映出这一点。
哦，这个小玩意儿也是给你的，这样你们就不会认为我懒惰地待在这里，却让你们做所有的工作了。
npc conversation	You’ve done it! I am… amazed. *Verdant is visibly trying to keep her composure, though it’s fair to assume she’d try at least poke your face to get a touch of heroism.* It can’t have been easy, I shudder at the mere thought of diving deep underwater with suits of this era… That sounds absolutely insane.
Really? Not that terrifying? Guess that’s why you’re the heroes and I’m the hero-remover. Hehe.
The consortium doesn’t know yet about the things that have transpired here. Thank goodness they’re usually pretty confused about what’s going on and where. But with your abilities, soon there will be nothing to know about. Or at least nothing to know about in fury. Thank you, on my behalf, and on the behalf of the people of Antagrich. 
What did Katherine do in the meanwhile, huh? Aside of bossing you around and stirring trouble with that Elven King. You should be the one patting her on shoulder and telling her good job on the paperwork.
Here, I’ve made something for you. I hope you find it useful.	你成功了！我很惊讶。 [显然，维尔丹正在努力保持镇定，虽然感觉她恨不得想戳一下你的脸以摸一摸英雄]这可并不容易，我对穿着衣服潜入深水的想法感到震惊……这听起来绝对是疯了。
真的？不那么恐怖吗？大概这就是为什么你是英雄，而我是英雄去除者吧。呵呵。
会社目前还不知道这里发生的事情。谢天谢地，他们通常对发生的事情和发生的地方感到困惑。但是凭借你的能力，很快就没有什么事情需要他们知道的了。至少没有什么事情需要他们愤怒地获知的。我代表我和恩塔格瑞人民，谢谢你。
凯瑟琳同时做了什么，是吧？除了命令你四处游荡，并招惹那个精灵王的麻烦。你应该拍拍她，并告诉她文书工作做得很好。
这儿，我为你做了点东西。希望对你有用。
npc conversation	Hey! Congratulations! That was a true show of power. Though I have to say, I felt a little sad watching Escaton die. There was something affable about the fella, something tragic to his story, don’t you think? 
But I am glad to see our Elemental Lord friends back in their happy little dimensions. They’re kind of like your friendly neighborhood wild animals, breaks my heart to see them suffer. Don’t scowl at me, I absolutely love animals so it’s definitely a compliment!
Only shame the crystal is gone. I was meaning to chip some off it for jewelry purposes, but I didn’t get around to it in time. Oh well, maybe in the next iteration, right?
I’ve made a little something for you. Infused with love and adoration!	嘿！恭喜你！那真是力量的真正体现。尽管看着爱斯卡顿死了，我感到有些伤心。这家伙还是挺可亲的，他的故事挺悲剧，你不觉得吗？
但是我很高兴看到我们的元素之王朋友们快乐地回到他们的维度中去。他们有点像那些友善的野生动物，看到他们受了苦我很伤心。不要生我的气，我绝对喜欢动物，所以这绝对是一种赞美！
只可惜水晶不见了。我本来想削掉一点儿做成珠宝，但是我还没来得及去做。哦，好吧，下一次吧，对不？
我为你做了点东西。里面充满了爱与崇拜！
npc conversation	Hey! Got my letter? I must speak with you. It’s a matter of an utmost importance. Though even ‘utmost’ can’t convey just how important the matter is. 
*The woman glances you over with a firm frown forming on her brow* 
How are you doing, by the way? Any sudden pains? Feeling strangely empty inside? Nothing? Well, that’s a relief, I have to say. Though I was pretty sure I had the hang of it by now. Third time’s the charm, aye?	嘿！收到我的信了吗？我必须和你谈谈。这件事至关重要。尽管即使“至关重要”也无法形容事情的重要性。
[这名女子紧皱眉头，向你瞥了一眼]
顺便问一下，你好吗？有突然的痛苦吗？感觉内心很空虚吗？没有？好吧，我必须说这是一种解脱。尽管我很确定自己现在已经拥有了，三倍的魅力，是吧？
npc conversation	Hey, you are here. Well, you need this letter to jump on path of previous heroes... You're a bunch of happy kids saved by a nice warlock fellow, spent your lives training, now all grown up and ready to roll. No need for a heavy roleplay, just don't be jerks. Go around, slap some goblins, squash a spider or two, poke a devil. Umm... I mean, an apprentice wizard, yes. No devils anywhere, forget the devils. I don't think I should be telling you things about your future. Well, their future. But also your future now. You know what I mean.	嘿，你们在这里。好吧，你们需要这封信才能重新走上以前的英雄之路……你们是一群快乐的孩子，被一个好法师救了下来，花了不少时间训练，现在都长大了，可以放手一搏了。你们无需扮演沉重的角色，但也不要吊儿郎当的。四处走走，打掉几个大耳怪，踩扁一两个蜘蛛，刺一刺恶魔。嗯……我是说，你们现在还是学徒期，是的。哪儿都没有魔鬼，忘了魔鬼吧。我认为我不应该告诉你们有关你们未来的事情。好吧，其实是他们的未来。但也是你的未来。你懂的。
npc conversation	*Suddenly Verdant appears from behind* Boo! You've passed time! Town, people around, can you believe they are older than you or have not even born at the point of "your real time", how it feels? Don't tell me, I have something for you - Connector Gem.	[维尔丹突然从后面出现]啊呀！你们已经超时了！镇上的人们，你们能相信他们比你们大，或者在“你们真实的时间点”上还没有出生吗，感觉如何？别说。我有一个东西要给你们——连接石。
