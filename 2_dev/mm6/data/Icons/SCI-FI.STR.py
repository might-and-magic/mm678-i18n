The drone-bots have gone mad and have started killing everyone in sight.  I was able to access the main control terminal on Level Four despite warnings of a hazardous leak, and I sent a distress signal, but since we have not had contact with any of the colonies for several weeks, I do not believe that a rescue is possible.  I have also managed to seal this facility so that the drones can not escape.  It is my hope that the colonists will be able to mount some sort of defense by the time my encryption codes are broken.
