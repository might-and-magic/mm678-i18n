Unfortunately, Archibald’s attempts at extracting information from me have damaged me enough that I cannot help you directly now.  Instead, I can only give you advice.\n\nWhile most of the Kreegan can be slain with ordinary weapons and spells, the elite guards and upper echelon breeders have tougher skin and natural defenses that protect them from anything but very powerful weapons.  In the planetary control center beneath me are the weapons and armor you will need to survive battle with the enemy.  My orders, however, will only permit passage to someone with a Control Cube.

You will need a powerful spell to prevent the explosion from damaging the planet, but no spell like that exists in the world today.  The only person I can think of that would know of such a spell is Archibald, but he is in no condition to teach you.

It was thought at the time they simply needed certain minerals, and could be reasoned with, but this was not the case.  Their life cycle forces them to breed until the world cannot support their numbers, then they send ships off to other worlds to renew the cycle.  Their attacks against the empire of the Ancients disrupted the network of shipping and communications that held us all together, causing the Silence that marks the first year of our modern calendar.  Without support from the homeworlds, our fledgling technology failed, bringing us to this sorry state.  I would help rebuild our technology, but I seem to have become a religious figure in the minds of many people, and very few visit me or understand what I have to offer.
