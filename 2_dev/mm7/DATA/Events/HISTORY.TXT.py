'2\t' + _x("history", "Castle Harmondale was completed in 689 as the first line of defense against Elvish forces led by King Lothoe IV during the Timber Wars.  In a sign of things to come, It fell to an Elvish assault just three years later at the infamous Battle for Harmondale.  Since then, the castle has changed hands 13 times in bloody conflicts with hundreds of deaths.  In all but two of the cases, the castle has been controlled by either Erathia or Avlee, but those two cases are remarkable.  \n\nIn 817, the long suffering citizens of Harmondale tore the cruel Baron Danforth Octavio to pieces in the streets over his enthusiastic tax collection methods.  Seizing the moment, the mob elevated mayor Ty Vespin to King of Harmondale, and installed him in the castle.  The glorious reign of King Vespin the First lasted exactly six weeks.  Erathian King Aaron Gryphonheart IV marched on the town with two veteran legions, and put King Vespin and his loudest supporters to the sword.  With this \"victory\" in hand, King Gryphonheart then marched upon the elves, who slew him in battle two weeks later.  The castle returned to Elvish control in 818.\n\nMore recently, the Necromancer Lord Terrence Rockwin II seized the castle as part of his expansion plans in 1008.  The few citizens who survived this conquest did so by hiding in the hills for the year he was in control of the castle.  Witnesses reported signs of a frenzied excavation taking place at the castle, but when Harmondale was retaken in the fall of 1009, no evidence of digging or construction could be found.  For that matter, no prisoners ever taken to the castle by the Necromancers were ever seen again.") + '\tForward\t' + _x("history", "What Has Gone Before") + '\r\n'

There was, I am sad to say, no ceremony or welcoming party.  As a matter of fact, a small band of goblins have moved in the castle and refuse to leave without a fight.  I, for one, am forced to stay in the town inn until they are evicted.  \n\nI must describe the townspeople's attitude toward their new lords as \"guardedly hostile\".  There is no expectation that they will last longer than a few months, little hope they will be any better than the last lords, and a good deal of fear they will be much, much worse.  Given the history of this place, I can' t blame them, but I do hope they will be proven wrong.\n\nThe traditional rulers of Harmondale--Erathia and Avlee, have not really noticed the change in ownership, but I'm sure that's just an oversight that will be corrected soon.  Since Harmondale is currently under human rulership, I expect the Queen's tax collectors will be by shortly to inquire.") + '\tAct 1\t' + _x("history", "The Great Contest") + '\r\n'

Emissaries were sent to the surrounding countries to herald this declaration, and in response, Erathia and Avlee have sent ambassadors to Castle Harmondale to officially represent their positions.  \n\nMore importantly, King Hothfarr was so grateful for the aid at the mine that he has sent an engineer and construction crew to make long overdue repairs to the castle and the town.  I have witnessed the work, and I must say I am impressed!  Rubble that has been in the castle since the defeat of Lord Rockwin II more than 150 years ago has finally been removed, revealing several more rooms that haven't been used since then.\n  \nEven the usually pessimistic townspeople have begun to cheer up.  Though most of the improvements to the town are cosmetic, the effect has been electrifying!  Business is positively booming, morale is up, and there is a real feeling that the worst days are behind us.  Providence willing, taxes will remain low, and good fortune will remain high.

My lords' effectiveness has made this territory a valuable resource, and both powers wish to claim Harmondale as theirs.  Though currently under Erathian jurisdiction, Avlee has asserted its right to the territory under the treaty of Tularea (signed in 673).  Erathia, of course, responded to that claim by pointing out Avlee's treaty abrogation in 811 under the Declarations and Annunciation's clause.  The position of Avlee on THAT issue has been to deny abrogation under the doctrine of Traitors and Miscreants, established circa. 375 by the great warlord Sardowin One-Eye. \n\nThere is a response to that claim as well, and a response to the response, ad infinitum.  The subject of international relations is worthy of many books, but isn't in the scope of this history.  Suffice it to say that both sides believe there is sufficient reason to spill blood, and that spilling is likely to happen in and around Harmondale.  I fear for the future.\n\nThe townspeople have taken the announcement of war in stride, but there is an undercurrent of worry.  I am sure the pressure on my lords to choose a side is intense.

I am sure their decision will be a wise one.\n\nIn other developments, ambassadors from Deyja, land of the Necromancers, and Bracada, land of the Wizards, have arrived.  They have come to announce their countries' recognition of my lords as rightful rulers in Harmondale, and no doubt to secure diplomatic favors.

Careful thought and sound reasoning narrowed the vampire's possible hiding places, which turned out to be a wine cellar underneath a completely ordinary home.  On %30 the vampire lord was slain, and his minions swiftly followed him into permanent death.  \n\nConcerning our enemies in Deyja, a major development has appeared.

They say they came here because their magical devices detected the ruins of Ancient civilization, and the equipment to open the gate to the stars and walk amongst them as easily as you and I would cross a room.  They say they intended to return the lost glory of the Ancient's civilization to our world.\n\nBut when they arrived, Kastore and his faction had tired of their search, and renounced their long held dream of finding the Ancients.  They preferred instead to take command of our world and lead it to greatness with the benefit of their superior wisdom and science. The others, obsessed with their original mission, refused to see reason and continued their pointless quest.\n\nTheir enemies say they need but one more piece to repair the road to the stars, and that piece is in the vehicle they used to get to our world.  Kastore's faction also requires this piece to finish their own project--the repair of the Heavenly Forge.  If Kastore's faction receives this artifact, they would use the forge to duplicate their powerful weapons and assume command of our world.  If Ressurectra and her team receives the artifact, they will use it to open the gate to the stars with unknown consequences, possibly opening a hole into the void or offering monsters from other stars like the Devils a way to invade our world.\n\nNow it is up to my lords to retrieve this artifact from their vehicle and return it to one of the two factions of outsiders.  I think Kastore means well, but my judgement has been wrong in the past. ") + '\tAct 3 Evil\t' + _x("history", "The Visitors") + '\r\n'
