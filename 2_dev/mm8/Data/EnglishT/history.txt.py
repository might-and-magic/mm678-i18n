As tales go, it is one where the mighty fall, and the weak become mighty; a story of great peril averted by heroes who cling doggedly to the great duties that have fallen upon them. Today I tell you the tale of %31 who rose from complete obscurity to become the greatest hero of our times—the toast of Jadame! And how %33 saved the land from the dread Destroyer.\n\nFor all the havoc he caused, the Destroyer was seen but once in the land of Jadame. It was a bright winter day when the Destroyer walked with unknowable purpose into the port city of Ravenshore. As you may know, Ravenshore is a town rare among Jadamean towns in its tolerance of outsiders, but the appearance of an unescorted man of apparent wealth excited the attention of the local muggers and cutpurses. Their avarice turned to fear, however, as one after another of them approached him with cunning intent only to be hurled away by unseen forces as the Destroyer calmly strolled towards the town commons.\n\nThis did not go unnoticed. Soon Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves, and other townsfolk poured from the houses and shops to follow (at a safe distance) this silent and oblivious stranger. When he reached the commons, a large crowd had gathered—much to their own tragedies, for many were torn asunder or otherwise injured by the cosmic forces he unleashed. Striking the ground with his scepter, the Destroyer caused great crystals to rise from the ground. Those that were not felled by the breaking of the earth, were blown back by the waves of fire and air which burst forth as the crystals formed a gigantic edifice of glowing diamond. As the structure formed around the Destroyer, he was soon obscured from sight.\n\nThe Destroyer was gone. Indeed, it would have seemed a dream if not for the solid reality of the crystal edifice—so large was it that it dwarfed the shops and buildings of the town square around it.\n\nThis was not the end of it. What was done by the Destroyer was felt in the far reaches of the Jadamean frontier. With the crystal came floods, firestorms, maelstroms, and volcanoes. And with these came raiders from the elemental planes. It seemed the crystal had more purpose than to disappear the Destroyer and to cause consternation among the denizens of Ravenshore. It was there also to act as a great rallying beacon—to call into being a great war between this plane and the planes of earth, air, water, and fire.\n\n%31 would probably not have been immediately aware of these great happenings if %33 had not been employed by the august Merchants of Alvar to stand guard over a wagonload of tobersk fruit waiting for transport from the Dagger Wound Islands. But this being the case, %33 along with the primitive Dagger Wound Lizardmen was witness to terrible destruction. Within sight of the shores of the main island, a great volcano thrust itself from the sea, pushing before it a mighty wave. This wave and the burning rocks which rained from the sky caused much havoc among the Lizardmen’s fields and huts—and made short work of the bridges connecting the inhabited islands to one another and to the Jadamean mainland.\n\nTurmoil ruled for a day and night on Dagger Wound as rocks continued to hurl from the sky, but this was not the end, for on the next day the Regnan Pirates attacked. Now I am not one to unfairly malign a whole people, but the Regnans are the worst I can think of. Like wolves falling on a wounded calf they struck the crippled island with merciless intent. Attacking from their great sea boats, the Regnans started a brutal campaign of raid and pillage.\n\nAnd so situated was %31 the day Destiny chose %34 as champion of the land.") + '\tForward\t' + _x("history", "Day of the Destroyer") + '\r\n'
'2\t' + _x("history", "That the situation was perilous was not lost on Dadeross who was %31’s caravan leader and a Minotaur of astute character. Dadeross knew that what he had witnessed would be of interest to his Dark Elven masters, the Merchants of Alvar. With this in mind, he called forth his faithful caravan guard, %31 and charged %34 with a task. \"You must deliver word of this calamity to Elgar Fellmoon, the merchant guildmaster in Ravenshore. He will need to know what to do.\"\n\nHe handed %31 a letter. “I know we are trapped here by circumstances and pirates, but you must find a way to reach the mainland. Go!” And with this, Dadeross turned to other matters.\n\n%31 was not, however without further help. Brekish Onefang, the Lizardman village chieftain told %34 of the existence of ancient travel portals which, before they ceased functioning, provided a means of travel between the islands. Onefang too told %31 of Fredrick Talimere a cleric who lived in the village and was knowledgeable of the portals workings.\n\nWhen %31 tracked Talimere down, %33 found the cleric knew not only of the portals, but also of an ancient temple through which lay a passage leading to the heretofore unreachable boat docks on an island isolated by the destruction of the bridges.\n\nAnd so, with Talimere’s help, %31 sallied forth. Oh, the way was blocked by many perils, not the least being the battle fought between Lizardmen and Regnans, but %31 prevailed through. Repairing the portals, %33 soon stood before the ancient temple.\n\nOne would think a place so long abandoned would be uninhabited, but such was not the case. Entering within, %31 was assailed by all manner of grotesque reptiles. Worst among them were serpents who were shaped like men, but did not possess the spark of intellect. This was not the end of the temple's dangers. Traps long set by unknown hands triggered at every step deeper into the depths. It was only by the skin of %32 teeth that %31 was able to forge through to emerge alive near the boat docks and take %32 passage to Ravenshore on the mainland.") + '\tEscaping the Island\t' + _x("history", "The World Must Know!") + '\r\n'
'3\t' + _x("history", "As mentioned, Ravenshore is a city unlike any other on Jadame. There, for the sake of trade, all races—at least in the light of day, and in the more populated streets—forsake their mutual enmity. One would be a fool to say that peace reigns there, but still at least business can be done. In any event, Ravenshore is where Elgar Fellmoon, master trader of the Merchants of Alvar ran his trade.\n\n“This is serious,” said Fellmoon upon receiving Dadeross’ letter. “Not only is the loss of his caravan a major loss to the guild, but the events on Dagger Wound and yon giant crystal….” He pointed to the massive glowing diamond left by the Destroyer. “…quite possibly prophesize the end of the world! What we need is more information, and I have just the plan for getting it.”\n\nFellmoon quickly penned off a letter and handed it to %31. “Take this to the leader of the local smuggling ring, Arion Hunter. He has some of the fastest boats on the coast, which my scouts will need. This letter requests their use. Hunter owes me, shall we say, ‘special considerations.’ I’m sure he’ll prove helpful.”\n\nAnd so, after certain misunderstandings with Hunter’s guards which left many of them variously indisposed, %31 delivered Fellmoon’s request to the smuggler leader who, after reading Fellmoon’s letter felt the call of duty and gladly gave over his boats to the merchant’s use.") + '\tBlackmail Done\t' + _x("history", "The Wererat Smuggler") + '\r\n'
'4\t' + _x("history", "When %31 returned to the merchant house after settling things with the Ravenshore smugglers, %33 found Fellmoon had another task ready. “It is certainly good that I know of what you’ve seen, but this news must also be carried to the main merchant guild in Alvar. The high guildmaster, Bastian Loudrin must also be informed. While I suspect we have seen signs of prophecy, I do not know it for sure. Bastian was always more interested in lore than I. He would know better.”\n\nNow by this point, %31 had gathered a group of followers; those of great deeds tend to attract the company of other glory seekers. And so when %31 went to the Dark Elven homeland of Alvar, %33 did not travel alone. And a good thing was that, for between Ravenshore and Alvar lay much hinterland—and for the Jadamean traveler, that means many encounters with highwaymen and hostile creatures. And indeed, many such encounters were had. For this, %31 and friends arrived at Alvar road weary.\n\nBastian Loudrin took %31’s report of events in Ravenshore and Dagger Wound with a dismay equal to that of Fellmoon’s. Loudrin too saw in the news signs of prophecy. “It is as foretold in the Ekelbreth Sumanunala, our lore of the end times. If your news and other rumors are to be believed, great and horrible events are about to occur. We can prevent these—the prophecy describes a route to salvation—but we must be sure. More evidence is needed.”\n\nAnd so the guild master recruited %31 and company into his service. He describe to the adventurers a persistent rumor which described the appearance of a burning lake of fire in the Ironsand Desert. “You must confirm or deny this story for me. Go to the desert. If this lake does exist, find me a witness to the events who is willing to accompany you back here. I must hear with my own ears proof. Then I will know if the last days are here.”") + '\tFind me a Witness\t' + _x("history", "A Visit to Alvar") + '\r\n'
'5\t' + _x("history", "Now as %31 was to discover upon arriving in Ironsand, the rumors were true. A horizon spanning lake of blazing fire endlessly flamed with fierce heat. It was a strange and troubling mystery for it burned without fuel unless that fuel was the unburnable sand—and that was impossible. Of further seeming impossibility was finding a witness to the lake’s formation, all of these having perished in the witnessing. But through diligent searching, one survivor was discovered, Overdune Snapfinger, a Troll of Rust village. Unfortunately, Overdune was little willing to go with %31 to Alvar.\n\n“Yes, I saw the fire lake made, but I cannot go with you. I must stay here to tend to my father who sickens with grief caused by the deathly unrest of my brother, Vilebite. He died in the fire, which is bad enough. Worse is that we have been unable to intern his remains in the family tomb. My father suffers for he believes Vilebite will not know rest until his body is properly dealt with.”\n\nHearing this, %31 offered to deliver Vilebite’s body to the tomb if Overdune would then agree to go to Loudrin. “Certainly,” said the Troll handing %31 a small vial of ashes. “Here is all that is left of poor Vilebite. The tomb is just outside the village. Return here when you are done and I will accompany you. Oh, and by the way, the tomb has become infested with Gogs—demonkind who hurl balls of exploding fire.”\n\nAnd so, sooner than can be told, %31 and company found themselves in the mazelike Troll village tomb which was aptly described by one of the party. “If we were not beset by maniacal fiends bent on our destruction, this would be a blessed and restful place.” With stalwart determination, the party faced down the Gogs and so won through to the Snapfingers’ family crypt. Leaving behind Vilebite’s scarce residue they returned to Overdune.\n\n“I will now travel with you,” said the satisfied Overdune. “See, my father already recovers and can care for himself.” And indeed, the hoary old Troll, clearly on the mend, was at the hut’s coarse table spooning his own soup. “Let’s go to Alvar, I will gladly give my report to the guild.”") + '\tOverdune Joins\t' + _x("history", "A Lake of Fire") + '\r\n'
'6\t' + _x("history", "At the guild, Overdune delivered his report. Throughout the telling of his tale of the fire lake’s appearance, Bastian Loudrin became increasingly concerned. “It is as I’ve feared. These are the end times! But fortunately, our fate is not sealed. The prophecy presents us with a choice—we can either do nothing and face utter annihilation in a conflagration of uncontrolled elemental energy, or we can follow the steps to salvation laid out in the prophecy. Personally, I prefer the latter.”\n\n“The prophecy is quite clear regarding what must be done, even if what must be done is no easy task. Roughly translated it says, ‘The land that stands together will be saved. That which does not will perish.’ I take this to mean we must form an alliance among the races of Jadame to stand against the threat of our impending oblivion. It further goes on to describe a hero who will doom or save the land. I cannot help but notice that you, %31, greatly resemble the hero of the prophecy.”\n\nAnd so, %31 was charged with the weight of greatness and became the identified, Hero of Jadame. No shirker was %33, but where to begin? Daunted by the magnitude of the duty placed on %34, %33 asked the guild master for advice. Loudrin considered for a moment before replying.\n\n“I suppose you must travel the land and seek the aid of your fellow Jadameans. I suggest you seek out the kings, chieftains, guild masters and other leaders. Press them with the idea of alliance. No doubt many suffer from the consequences of elemental cataclysms like the Dagger Wound volcano or the Ironsand fire lake. They will understand the gravity of the situation and will grasp at a solution cleverly presented.”\n\n“When you find allies, send them to Ravenshore. I will send a messenger to Fellmoon instructing him that his merchant house is now the alliance headquarters. You already have the support of the Dark Elves and the Trolls. Find others.”") + '\tForm an Alliance Given\t' + _x("history", "The Prophecy") + '\r\n'
'7\t' + _x("history", "The best allies would be found among the most powerful creatures, and none are more powerful than the Dragons. Such was %31’s reasoning which brought the adventurers to the Dragon caves of Garrote Gorge. Some of the company had their misgivings, but then there was no time for backing out, for suddenly they were confronted by the Dragons guarding the cave entrance. Now fortunately, these were the cooler headed sort of Dragons, and %31 was allowed to state %32 business instead of being instantly slain. Escorted by several battle ready Dragons, the party was escorted into the caves and to the personal cavern of Deftclaw Redreaver, the King of Dragons.\n\n“Normally you would not have come within a hundred paces of our cave…at least not alive, but these are not normal times,” said Redreaver. “It is clear to me that the days are charged with doom. I am inclined to believe Bastian Loudrin’s prophecy, but our own troubles must stand first. You see, we Dragons fight a battle for existence. We are hunted. If you go down to the plains at the foot of our mountains, you will see a great camp of dragon hunters.”\n\n“But why do you not simply slay the hunters and be done with the issue?” asked %31.\n\n“We dare not attack them directly,” replied the Dragon king. “They hold hostage an egg fathered by me and which contains the unborn prince who will one day succeed me as king. If that egg was not in their hands, I could help you, until then, I cannot.”\n\n%31’s course of action was clear. With party in tow, %33 went off in search of the Dragon king’s egg. A bit of evidence gathering revealed that the egg wasn’t with the dragon hunters at all! In fact, they had already sold the egg to Zog the Jackal, an ogre chieftain of Ravage Roaming.\n\nAnd so the adventure was carried to Zog’s badlands fortress. With weapons drawn %31 and company charged the fortress gates. Through might and verve they won through the guards and made their way into Zog’s keep. Finding the egg, they made good their escape.

A chance to battle against a great danger to the land would be just the thing. Unfortunately, we have some business to tie up here before I could even consider joining with you.”\n\n“Unfinished business?” prompted %31.\n\n“Yes,” replied Quixote. “For example, I sold a dragon egg on credit to a certain Zog the Jackal, a barbarian of the Ravage Roaming badlands. He took the goods and then later refused to pay. Those who I’ve sent to collect never returned. If he had not slain my couriers, I might have let the matter go, but now it has become an affair of honor. I’m sorry, I can’t be a part of the alliance until after I recover the egg.

With little ado they gained an audience with the high priest, Oskar Tyre.\n\n“As you know, the Brotherhood of the Sun is always looking for opportunities to walk in the Light. Your alliance sounds like such, but a greater calling is upon us. You see, we make holy war on the evil Necromancers’ Guild in Shadowspire. All of our resources are involved there, and quite frankly the war could be going better. Say, %31! Perhaps you could help our cause. If you did so, we would surely be able to join you.”\n\n“Help in what way?” asked %31. “What could my small party do that your army could not?”\n\n“That you are small and not of us, precisely serves my plan. The guild would not suspect you of mischief and would allow you to enter their fortress. I have an agent placed among their number. You could meet up with him and help him to strike at their heart. In their headquarters is a device called a ‘skeleton transformer.’ If you destroyed it, this would greatly reduce the size of the army they could field. Then my forces would quickly win the campaign.”\n\n%31 took %32 leave. Making quick preparations, the adventurers departed for Shadowspire. There, true to the head priest’s word, they entered the guild fortress unchallenged. There they found the temple agent, Dyson Leland, a cleric posing as a necromancer.\n\nTaking stock of the party, Leland was pleased. “Together we can deliver the foul necromancers a terrible blow. While you hold off their guards, I can cast the spells which will demolish the skeleton transformer. Arm yourselves. We strike immediately!”\n\nAnd so they set off through the guild’s stone corridors. It was only when they neared the transformer that they were challenged. It was an area of the guild that Leland was not allowed to enter. Fortunately, he had %31 and company to force the issue. Leaving fallen guards behind them, the adventurers soon stood before the skeleton transformer. Leland had been preparing himself for a long time to deal with the dread device and so made short work of its destruction.\n\nMaking their escape, the party returned to Murmurwoods and the Sun Temple where they were received with a hero’s welcome.

This is not the case; I cherish my existence.” He waved a bony hand in a gesture of regret. “Unfortunately, this is more immediately imperiled by the Temple of the Sun. They have declared holy war on us. I cannot join you while we battle them.”\n\n“Perhaps we can help,” offered %31.\n\n“Yes, perhaps you can.” Sandro thought a moment. “I have just the idea! Before they sent their troops against us, agents of the temple came here and stole a valuable artifact from us—the Nightshade Brazier. It produces a region of perpetual darkness. While we had it, our vampires could move around Shadowspire both day and night. Now they must hide from the sun. If we had the brazier back, the vampires could defend our lands and free up troops to take against the temple. We would win the war in short order.”\n\nAnd so the party went to the Temple of the Sun in Murmurwoods. Bringing with them Dyson Leland, a former priest of the temple, now turned to the service of the necromancers, they made their way into the temple. Though the temple guardians fought fiercely, in the end they were no match for the skillful battle craft employed against them by %31 and company. The adventurers won the brazier and returned with it to Shadowspire.\n\n“Excellent!” cried Sandro upon their return. “Now we will surely defeat the Temple.

'17\t' + _x("history", "Once outside the palace, %31 examined the Destroyer’s keys. The gems in their heads were of elemental heartstone—each key having one of the four types, earth, air, water, and fire. “Perhaps they open doors into some of the strange buildings here,” suggested one of the party.\n\nIt seemed like a strong possibility, so %31 and %32 followers began to search the area around the palace. Some of the buildings had doors with no keyholes apparent. Others had no doors at all, being unprotected shells open to all. But there were four structures which were different. Though these had no visible doors, approaching each caused one of the Destroyer’s four keys to glow with light emitted from its gem head. There was a structure which acted in this fashion for each key. A bit of experimentation revealed that in the presence of the proper key, these structures’ walls would become as permeable as a wall of fog.\n\nAnd so, the adventurers entered each of the four structures. And each was the prison of one of the four elemental lords. Since they were powerful enough to thwart the enslaving effects of the Ravenshore crystal upon their subjects, the Destroyer had imprisoned them to expedite his mission.\n\nIn a prison of water the adventurers found and freed Pyrannaste, Lord of Fire. His opposite, Acwalander, Lord of Water, they found in a cell of burning walls. The building where Gralkor the Cruel, Lord of Earth, was impossibly filled with clouds and sky, and his cell was suspended in air without any visible support. They found the Lord of Air, Shalwend, in a deep earthen cavern.\n\nUpon his release, Shalwend thanked %31. “Thanks to you, my ordeal, and the ordeal of my subjects is over. I go now to set thing right in my airy realm. Between us, my brother lords and I have the power to undo the Destroyer. This we will do directly. I suggest you make haste to leave this plane and return to your own.”") + '\tElemental Lords all Rescued\t' + _x("history", "The Elemental Lords") + '\r\n'
'18\t' + _x("history", "It was fortunate that %31 heeded Shalwend’s urgings towards haste, else wise %33 and %32 group might have been trapped without a way back to their own plane. Stopping only when confronted by lingering opponents, the adventurers hurried across the lands of chaos, through the crystal passage, and back to the town square on Ravenshore. There they were met by Xanthor who seemed to be waiting for them.\n\n“Good work,” said the mage, “and you’ve arrived just in time, to see the results. Step back from the crystal and behold! The elemental lords approach.”\n\nThe adventurers did as Xanthor asked. As they withdrew from the crystal’s vicinity they could feel the ground tremble as the lords, now grown to gigantic proportions, stepped into the town square. With destructive intent they focused on the crystal. Then as one, they began to hurl beams of pure elemental force upon the Destroyer’s foul gem. At first it resisted the potent energies, but then the lords stepped up their attack. As they played their mighty rays against its facets, the crystal began to glow and vibrate. A great keening note, like the tolling of a hundred church bells filled the air. And then, with an endless cacophony of shattering glass, the crystal was no more.\n\nTheir work done, the lords departed. Gralkor sunk into the ground beneath his feet, and Acwalander dissolved into a great wash of water which flowed into the Alvar river running through town. Pyrannaste became a great ball of fire which rose and then hurled itself beyond the horizon. Shalwend lifted into the air changing as he wafted up into a cloud blown on a vigorous wind. “Farewell.” he said in a fading voice. “This is your day, Heroes of Jadame. Farewell…”\n\nAnd so ends the tale of the Day of the Destroyer, and of the adventure that brought %31 to be so well known in these lands—how %33, by saving the land from aboslute peril, came from complete obscurity to become the toast of all the tavern goers. What new tales will be told of this mighty adventurer, only time will tell. But as sure as %31 roams the expanse of Jadame, I’m sure they will be many.\n\nEND") + '\tCrystal Destroyed\t' + _x("history", "Heroes of Jadame") + '\r\n'
