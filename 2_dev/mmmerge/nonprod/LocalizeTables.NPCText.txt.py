We are a group of mages who researched the intricacies of time travel for the purpose of documenting the history of our world. Pure, untainted, unbiased. Something humans entangled in their affairs and fettered by political agendas are obviously incapable of doing. As the saying goes, ‘Winners write history’. And hence, we’ve mastered the art of time travel to witness the history and document it objectively, straighten out the mangled facts, uncover the truth buried beneath convenient lies.\nIt’s been working out great, our archives grow with each excursion, but this time, a little something went… a little wrong.") + '\r\n'

I’ve chosen three groups of heroes whose deeds saved countless lives, and I’ve attuned my magic to visit them all at the very beginnings of their journeys.
