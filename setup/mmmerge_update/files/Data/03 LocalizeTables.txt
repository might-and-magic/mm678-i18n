TransTxt	20		As you go deeper into this vast network of tunnels, your instinct tells you that many dangerous creatures dwell within. You vow to remain vigilant.
TransTxt	22		A thunderous howl pierces your ears, provoking a feeling of dread. Whatever produced that sound is drawing near, with each step rocking the earth beneath your feet.

NPCText	1678		Congratulations, %s!
NPCText	1679		Your kind cannot become %s. Sorry.
NPCText	1680		Good tidings. I am %s, %s %s. I'd love to see the world and taste the adventure, but it'd be foolish to go alone. Perhaps I could come with you?

NPCText	2158		The Controlled Breach is a place the consortium has created where it’s possible to see and interact with the Runaway Chaos, and through which the Uneasy Origin Matter can be reached. It’s an artificial realm-esque area where matters *Verdant snickers* can be safely handled without jeopardizing any real world places. 
Ruins of Escaton's Crystal should be enough magic-filled to allow our old friend - town portal spell - teleport you there.
Once there, all you need to do is find the Runaway Chaos and return it to the Uneasy Origin Matter. What can you expect on the way? Aye, this even I cannot tell you. Since it’s a result of a time anomaly, we have obviously never seen it before. 
What will happen to you after you go in and leave?
Well, um. Let’s not overthink things. I’m sure it’s going to be fun, though!

NPCText	2104		Are you sure, you want to change your path? Dark spells will be vanished from your spellbook and dark magic will be erased from your mind. (Yes/No)
NPCText	2105		Are you sure, you want to change your path? Light spells will be vanished from your spellbook and light magic will be erased from your mind. (Yes/No)
NPCText	2106		It is never late to turn back to light, child. Choose light side.
NPCText	2107		Darkness wait and it's patience is eternal. Choose dark side.
NPCText	2108		yes
NPCText	2109		Either you've already choosen your path, or you are not ready to do it.
